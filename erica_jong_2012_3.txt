A bespectacled artist called Lear 
First perfected this smile in a sneer. 
He was clever and witty 
He gave life to this ditty That 
original author called Lear. 

The old poet 
with his face full of lines 
with iambs jumping in his hair like fleas 
with all the revisions of his body 
unsaying him 
walks to the podium. 

He is about to tell us 
how he came to this. 

After the first astounding rush 
after the weeks at the lake 
the crystal the clouds the water lapping the rocks 
the snow breaking under our boots like skin 
and the long mornings in bed

After the tangos in the kitchen 
and our eyes fixed on each other at dinner 
as if we would eat with our lids 
as if we would swallow each other

I find you still 
here beside me in bed 
while my pen scratches the pad 
and your skin glows as you read 
and my whole life so mellowed and changed 

that at times I cannot remember 
the crimp in my heart that brought me to you 
the pain of a marriage like an old ache 
a husband like an arthritic knuckle. 

Here living with you 
love is still the only subject that matters. 
I open to you like a flowering wound 
or a trough in the sea filled with dreaming fish 
or a steaming chasm of earth 
split by a major quake. 

You changed the topography. 
Where valleys were 
there are now mountains. 
Where deserts were 
there now are seas. 

We rub each other 
but we do not wear away. 

The sand gets finer 
and our skins turn silk. 

The best slave 
does not need to be beaten. 
She beats herself. 

Not with a leather whip 
or with stick or twigs 
not with a blackjack 
or a billyclub 
but with the fine whip 
of her own tongue 
and the subtle beating 
of her mind 
against her mind. 

For who can hate her half so well 
as she hates herself? 
and who can match the finesse 
of her selfabuse? 

Years of training 
are required for this. 
Twenty years 
of subtle selfindulgence 
selfdenial 
until the subject 
thinks herself a queen 
and yet a beggar both 
at the same time. 
She must doubt herself 
in everything but love. 

She must choose passionately 
and badly. 
She must feel lost as a dog 
without her master. 
She must refer all moral questions 
to her mirror. 
She must fall in love with a cossack 
or a poet. 

She must never go out of the house 
unless veiled in paint. 
She must wear tight shoes 
so she always remembers her bondage. 
She must never forget 
she is rooted in the ground. 

Though she is quick to learn 
and admittedly clever 
her natural doubt of herself 
should make her so weak 
that she dabbles brilliantly 
in half a dozen talents 
and thus embellishes 
but does not change 
our life. 

If she's an artist 
and comes close to genius 
the very fact of her gift 
should cause her such pain 
that she will take her own life 
rather than best us. 

and after she dies we will cry 
and make her a saint. 

The whole world is flat 
and I am round. 
Even women avert their eyes 
and men embarrassed 
by the messy way 
that life turns into life 
look away 
forgetting they themselves 
were once this roundness 
underneath the heart 
this helpless fish 
swimming in eternity. 

The sound of O 
not the sound of I 
embarrasses the world. 
My friends who voluntarily have made 
their bodies flat 
their writings flat as grief 
look at me in disbelief. 
What is this large unseemly thing
a pregnant poet? 
an enormous walking O? 
Oh take all the letters of the alphabet but that 
We speak the Esperanto of the flat 

Condemned to sign 
language and silence pregnant poems 
for men to snicker at 
for women to denounce 
I live alone. 
My world is round 
and bounded by the mountain of my fear 
while all the great geographers agree 
the world is flat 
and roundness cannot be. 

Could I unthink you 
little heart 
what would I do? 
throw you out 
with last night's garbage 
undo my own decisions 
my own flesh 
and commit you to the void 
again? 

Fortunately 
it is not my problem. 
You hold on beating 
like a little clock 
Swiss in your precision 
Japanese in your tenacity 
and already having 
your own karma 

while I with my halfhearted 
maternal urges 
my uncertainty that any creature 
ever really creates 
another unless it be 
herself know you 
as God's poem 
and myself merely as publisher 
as midwife 
as impresario 
oh even if you will 
as loath√®d producer 
of your Grand Spectacle 
you are the star 
and like your humblest fan 
I wonder 
gazing at your image 
on the screen 
who you really are. 

I am not interested 
in my body
the part that stinks 
and rots and brings forth 
life 
the part that the ground 
swallows 
death giving birth 
to death
all of life 
considered 
from the body's 
point of view 
is a downhill slide 
and all our small 
preservatives 
and griefs 
cannot reverse the trend. 

All sensualists 
turn puritan 
at the end
turning up lust's soil 
and finding bones 
beneath the rich volcanic 
dirt. 

Some sleep in shrouds 
and some in coffins 
some swear off 
procreation others turn 
vegetarian or worse 
they live on air
on sheer platonic meals 
of pure ideas 
once gluttons of the flesh 
they now become 
gourmets of the mind. 
How to resist that 
when the spacious earth 
swallows her children 
so insatiably 
when all our spaceage gods 
are grounded 
and only the moan of pleasure 
or the rasp of pain 
can ever satisfy 
the body's appetite? 

and yet my body 
in its dubious wisdom 
led to yours 
and you may 
puzzle out 
this mystery in your turn. 
Choose mind choose body 
choose to wed the two 
many have tried 
but few have done the deed. 

Through you perhaps 
I may at last succeed. 

At the edge of the body 
there is said to be 
a flaming halo
yellow red blue 
or pure white 
taking its color 
from the state 
of the soul. 

Cynics scoff. 
Scientists make graphs 
to refute it. 
Editorial writers 
journalists and even 
certain poets 
claim it is only mirage 
trumpedup finery 
illusory feathers 
spiritual shenanigans 
humbug. 

But in dreams 
we see it 
and sometimes even waking. 
If the spirit is a bride 
about to be married to God 
this is her veil. 

Do I believe it? 
Do I squint 
and regard the perimeter 
of my lover's body 
searching for some sign 
that his soul 
is about to ignite 
the sky? 

Without squinting 
I almost see it. 

An angry red aura 
changing to white 
the color of peace. 

I gaze at the place where he turns into air 
and the flames of his skin 
combine 
with the flames of the sky 
proving 
the existence 
of both. 

The lessons we learned here 
fumbling with our lunchbags 
handkerchiefs 
and secret cheeks of bubblegum 

were graver than any 
in the schoolroom 
the dangers of a life 
frozen into poses. 

Trilobites in their 
petrified ghettos 
lumbering dinosaurs 
who had outsized themselves 

told how nature was 
an endless morality play 
in which the cockroach 
and all such beadyeyed 

exemplars of adjustment 
might well recite the epilogue. 
No one was safe 
but stagnation was 

the surest suicide. 
To mankind's Hamlet 
what sixlegged creature would play 
Fortinbras? It made you scratch 

your head and think 
for about two minutes. 
Going out I remember 
how we stopped to look at 
Teddy Roosevelt 
Soldier Statesman Naturalist 
Hunter Historian 
et cetera et cetera. 

His bronze bulk four times life size 
bestrode Central Park West 
like a colossus. 
His monumental horse 

snorted towards the park. 
Oh we were full of Evolution and its lessons 
When the girls giggling madly 

the boys blushing we peeked 
between those huge legs to see 
those aweinspiring 
Brobdingnagian balls. 

I sit in the black leather chair 
meditating 
on the plume of smoke that rises 
in the air 
riffling the pages of my life 
as if it were a book of poems 
flipping through 
past and future. 

If I go back back back 
riding the plume of smoke 
I find I died 
in childbirth in another life 
died by fire in the life before that 
died by water twice or more. 

I pick out days 
and relive them 
as if I were trying on dresses. 

When the future beckons 
I follow 
riding another plume of smoke 
feeling the barrier 
between skin and air 
evaporate 
and my body disappear 
like the myth it is. 

My cheeks burn against the air 
flaming where two elements collide 
and intermingle 
becoming one. 

Oh explosion at the body's edge 
I live on a ledge of time 
gazing 
at the infinite. 

The lover in these poems 
is me 
the doctor 
Love. 
He appears 
as husband lover 
analyst and muse 
as father son 
and maybe even God 
and surely death. 

All this is true. 

The man you turn to 
in the dark 
is many men. 

This is an open secret 
women share 
and yet agree to hide 
as if 
they might then 
hide it from themselves. 

I will not hide. 

I write in the nude. 
I name names. 
I am I. 
The doctor's name is Love. 

Now moving in cartons on the floor 
the radio playing to bare walls 
picture hooks left stranded 
in the unsoiled squares where paintings were 
and something reminding us 
this is like all other moving days 
finding the dirty ends of someone else's life 
hair fallen in the sink a peach pit 
and burnedout matches in the corner 
things not preserved yet never swept away 
like fragments of disturbing dreams 
we stumble on all day
in ordering our lives we will discard them 
scrub clean the floorboards of this our home 
lest refuse from the lives we did not lead 
become in some strange frightening way our own. 
And we have plans that will not tolerate 
our fears a year laid out like rooms 
in a new housethe dusty wine glasses 
rinsed off the vases filled and bookshelves 
sagging with heavy winter books. 
Seeing the room always as it will be 
we are content to dust and wait. 
We will return here from the dark and silent 
streets arms full of books and food 
anxious as we always are in winter 
and looking for the Good Life we have made. 

I see myself then tense solemn 
in highheeled shoes that pinch 
not basking in the light of goals fulfilled 
but looking back to now and seeing 
a lazy sunburned sandaled girl 
in a bare room full of promise 
and feeling envious. 

Now we plan postponing pushing our lives forward 
into the futureas if when the room 
contains us and all our treasured junk 

we will have filled whatever gap it is 
that makes us wander discontented 
from ourselves. 

The room will not change 
a rug or armchair or new coat of paint 
will not make much difference 
our eyes are fickle 
but we remain the same beneath our suntans 
pale frightened 
dreaming ourselves backward and forward in time 
dreaming our dreaming selves. 

I look forward and see myself looking back. 

Babywitch 
my daughter 
my worship of the Goddess 
alone 
condemns you to the fire

I blow upon 
your least fingernail 
and it flares cyclamen and rose. 
I suck flames from your ears. 
I touch your perfect nostrils 
and they too flame gently 
like that pale rose 
called sweetheart. 

Your eyelids are tender purple 
like the base of the flame 
before it blues. 

O child of fire 
O tiny devotee of the Goddess

I wished for you 
to be born a daughter 
though we know 
that daughters 
cannot but be 

born for burning 
like the fatal 
tree. 

I was sick of being a woman 
sick of the pain 
the irrelevant detail of sex 
my own concavity 
uselessly hungering 
and emptier whenever it was filled 
and filled finally 
by its own emptiness 
seeking the garden of solitude 
instead of men. 

The white bed 
in the green gardenI 
looked forward 
to sleeping alone 
the way some long 
for a lover. 

Even when you arrived 
I tried to beat you 
away with my sadness 
my cynical seductions 
and my trick of 
turning a slave 
into a master. 

And all because 
you made 
my fingertips ache 
and my eyes cross 
in passion 
that did not know its own name. 

Bear beast lover 
of the book of my body 
you turned my pages 
and discovered 
what was there 
on the other side. 

And now 
I am blank 
for you 
a tabula rasa 
ready to be printed 
with letters 
in an undiscovered language 
by the great press 
of our love. 

Because I would not admit 
that I had nurtured 
an enemy within my breast

a lover who wanted to gnaw 
my secret rose 
a lover who wanted to press me 
between the covers of a book 
then burn it 
a loverusurper who wanted 
to take my soul

I nearly died 
running my car upon rocks 
like a badly steered sloop 
crashing into trees 
like a hurricane gale 
burning my arms in ovens 
when I thought I was only 
baking bread

To admit the betrayal 
was worse than 
the fact of betrayal
for I loved him 
as leaves love sun 
turning my face to him 
turning my hips my womb 
to be filled with a dream 
of children a dream of books 
and babies sprouting like leaves 
from a spring tree 
a dream of trees that leaked blood 
instead of sap

The dream¬πs the thing
the dream we die for 
turning our faces to the sun 
eyes closed never seeing it has 
gone out 
dead star it blazes coldly 
over a dead planet 
while we bask in its afterglow 
now remembered in the mind. 

He was fond 
of stars and telescopes 
fond of machines fond 
of building the most complex 
contraptions 
to scale the clouds. 
But Icarus flies 
near the sun with waxen wings 
and does not think of gears 
or motors. 

Trees rise up at him 
as he falls the earth 
rushes to meet him 
like a lover 
raising her writhing hips 
the wings weep their waxy tears 
and fall apart 
the sun is hot 
on his face. 

But even as he falls 
he is in ecstasy 
his sun has not 
gone out. 

For Jennifer Josephy 

On cold days 
it is easy to be reasonable 
to button the mouth against kisses 
dust the breasts 
with talcum powder 
and forget 
the red pulp meat 
of the heart. 

On those days 
it beats 
like a digital clock
not a beat at all 
but a steady whirring 
chilly as green neon 
luminous as numerals in the dark 
cool as electricity. 

and I think 
I can live without it all
love with its blood pump 
sex with its messy hungers 
men with their peacock strutting 
their silly sexual baggage 
their wet tongues in my ear 
and their words like little sugar suckers 
with sour centers. 

On such days 
I am zipped in my body suit 
I am wearing seven league red suede boots 
I am marching over the cobblestones 
as if they were the heads of men 

and I am happy 
as a sevenyearold virgin 
holding Daddy's hand. 

do not touch. 
do not try to tempt me with your ripe persimmons. 
do not threaten me with your volcano. 
The sky is clearer when I'm not in heat 
and the poems 
are colder. 

Next birthday 
I am thirtysix 
and formed for all intents 
and purposes 
in tooth and claw. 
Six books 
have peeled away 
all that I am 
and all 
that I am not 
I turn back pages now 
in history's dogeared 
book and write 
of other lives. 

and here you come 
pink as dawn 
rosy as the aurora borealis 
blooming over Yorkshire 
and the ruined abbeys 
of the Lake District 
curly as a baby sheep 
hungry as a little billy 
goat cuddly 
as a lap dog 
able to flex your spine 
to fit inside my own 
and born 
between piss 
and shit. 

I welcome you 
with all my breath 
and guts 
I hallelujah 
to your eyes your heart 
your tender toes. 
May I keep growing younger 
with your years 

until when you are just my age 
or more I have gone back to zero 
and am ready 
perhaps then 
to be reborn. 

I began by loving women 
and the love turned 
to bitterness. 

My mother the bitter 
whose bitter lesson
trust no one 
especially no male
caused me to be naive 
for too many years 
in mere rebellion 
against that bitterness. 

If she was Medea 
I would be Candide 
and bleed in every sexual war 
and water my garden with menstrual blood 
and grow the juiciest fruits. 

Like the woman 
who watered her roses with blood 
and won all the prizes 
though no one knew why. 

If she was Lady Macbeth 
I would be Don Quixote and 
never pass up a windmill 
without a fight 
and never choose discretion 
over valor. 

My valor was often foolish. 
I was rash 
though others called me brave. 
My poems were red flags 
To lure the bulls. 
The picadors smelled blood 
and jabbed my novels. 

I had only begun 
by loving women and 
ended by hating their deceit 
hating the hate 
they feed their daughters 
hating the selfhate 
they feed themselves 
hating the contempt 
they feed their men 
as they claim weakness
their secret strength. 

For who can be crueler 
than a woman 
who is cruel 
out of her impotence? 
and who can be meaner 
than a woman 
who desires 
the only room with a view? 

Even in chess 
she shouts 
Off with their heads
and the poor king 
walks one step forward 
one step back. 

But I began 
by loving women 
loving myself 
despite my mother's lesson 
loving my ten fingers 
ten toes my puckered navel 
my lips that are too thick 
and my eyes the color of ink. 

Because I believed in them 
I found gentle men. 
Because I loved myself 
I was loved. 
Because I had faith 
the unicorn licked my arm 
the rabbit nestled in my skirts 
the griffin slept 
curled up at the bottom 
of my bed. 

Bitter women 
there is milk under this poem. 
What you sow in blood 
shall be harvested in honey. 

Books which are stitched up the center with coarse white thread 
Books on the beach with sunglasscolored pages 
Books about food with pictures of weeping grapefruits 
Books about baking bread with browned corners 
Books about longhaired Frenchmen with uncut pages 
Books of erotic engravings with pages that stick 
Books about inns whose stars have sputtered out 
Books of illuminations surrounded by darkness 
Books with blank pages and printed margins 
Books with fanatical footnotes in nopoint type 
Books with book lice 
Books with ricepaper pastings 
Books with book fungus blooming over their pages 
Books with pages of skin with fleshcolored bindings 
Books by men in love with the letter O 
Books which smell of earth whose pages turn 

A delicate border. A nonexistent country. 
The train obligingly dissolves in smoke. 
The G.I. next to me is talking war. 
I do not know the Asian mind he says. 

Moving through old arguments. 

At Potsdam a globeshaped dome 
a pink canal reflecting sepia trees 
we pull next to a brokendown old train 
with REICHSBAHN lettered on its flank. 

Thirty years sheer away leaving bare cliff. 

This is a country I do not recognize. 
Bonepale girls who have nothing to do with home. 
Everyone's taller than me everyone naked. 
'Life's cheap there' he says. 

But why are we screaming over a track 
which runs between a barbed wire corridor? 
And why has it grown so dark outside 
so bright in here 

that even the pared moon is invisible? 

In the window we can only see ourselves 
America we carry with us 
two scared people talking death 
on a train which cannot stop. 

We sit on a rock 
to allow our souls 
to catch up with us. 

We have been traveling 
a long time. 

Behind us are forests of books 
with pages green as leaves. 
A blood sun stares 
over the horizon. 

Our souls are slow. 
They walk miles behind 
our long shadows. 

They do not dance. 
They need all their strength 
merely to follow us. 

Sometimes we run too fast 
or trip climbing 
the rotten rungs 
in fame's ladder. 

Our souls know 
it leads nowhere. 

They are not afraid 
of losing us. 

These beautifully grown men. These hungerers. 
Look at them looking 
They're overdrawn on all accounts but hope 
and they've missed 
for the hundredth time the express 
to the city of dreams 
and settled sighing for a desperate local 
so who's to blame them 
if they swim through swimming pools of twelveyear
old scotch or fall 
in love with widows other than their wives 
who suddenly cannot ride 
in elevators? In that suburb of elms 
and crabgrass to which 
the angel banished them nothing is more real 
than last night's empties. 

So if they pack up stuff their vitals 
in a twosuiter 
and with passports bluer than their eyes 
pose as barons 
in Kitzbuhel or poets in Portofino 
something in us sails 
off with them dreaming of baconlettuceand
tomato sandwiches. 
Oh all the exiles of the twenties knew 
that America 
was discovered this way desperate men 
wearing nostalgia 
like a hangover sailed out sailed out 
in search of passports 
eyes an ancient kingdom beyond the absurd 
suburbs of the heart. 

I want to understand the steep thing 
that climbs ladders in your throat. 
I cannot make sense of you. 
Everywhere I look you're there a 
vast landmark a volcano 
poking its head through the clouds 
Gulliver sprawled across Lilliput. 

I climb into your eyes looking. 
The pupils are black painted stage flats. 
They can be pulled down like window shades. 
I switch on a light in your iris. 
Your brain ticks like a bomb. 

In your offhand mocking way 
you have invited me into your chest. 
Inside the blur that poses as your heart. 
I am supposed to go in with a torch 
or maybe hot water bottles 
and defrost it by hand 
as one defrosts an old refrigerator. 
It will shudder and sigh 
the icebox to the insomniac. 

Oh there is nothing like love between us. 
You are the mountain I am climbing you. 
If I fall you will not be all to blame 
but you will wait years maybe 
for the next doomed expedition. 

Not that I cared about the other woman. 
Those perfumed breasts with hearts 
of pure rock salt. 
Lot's wives
all of them. 

I did not care 
if they fondled him at parties 
eased him in at home 
between a husband and a child 
sucked him dry 
with vacuum cleaner kisses. 

It was the coldness that I minded 
though he's warned me. 
I'm cold He said as if that helped any. 
But he was colder 
than he thought he was. 

Cold sex. 
A woman has to die 
and be exhumed 
four times a week 
to know the meaning of it. 

His hips are razors 
his pelvic bones are knives 
even his elbows could cut butter. 

Cold flows from his mouth 
like a cloud of carbon dioxide. 
Hie penis is pure dry ice 
which turns to smoke. 
His face hands over my face
An ice carving. 

One of these days 
he'll shatter 
or 
he'll melt. 

Handcuffed by time 
I travel across this broad 
beautiful America
mesas deserts 
peaks with clouds caught 
upon them 
the Continental Divide 
where a dropp of rain 
must decide 
whether to roll east or west 
like the rest of us. 

I speak to a group 
of avid aging Californians 
about daring to embrace 
the second half of life. 
The passions of the old 
are deeper 
than any wells 
the young can plumb. 

Meanwhile you are dying 
in New York Hospital
your beautiful face drained 
of blood 
your arms too heavy 

to seize the day 

your shining eyes 
dimmed by pain 
and drugs to dull it. 

You have boycotted food 
yet all you can do is apologize 
to your grieving children 
for the trouble you cause 
by dying. 

'do not worry I'm fine' 
you say eternal mother. 

Solitary as you will ever be 
our love cannot save you 
from this last loneliness 
this last sea voyage 

where no one 
dresses for dinner. 

Meanwhile 
I am listening to a doctor 
who claims we can all live 
to be a hundred 
a hundred and twenty 
If only we expand 
our arteries with exercise 
our genitals with sex 
our brains with crossword puzzles 
poems and proverbs

Wingless we can fly 
over death 
if only the body 
that laggard
consents. 

I suppose the dropp of rain decided 
to roll west with the setting sun 
taking you along. 

The Californian doctor is quoting 
Victor Hugo now 
the eyes of the young show flame 
the eyes of the old light. 

More light Doctor 
How can we accept 
time's jagged jaws 
even as we are being eaten? 
How can we accept 
the extinguishing of eyes? 
Doctor
is death the aberration. 
or is life? 
And as for love
why is it never enough 
to save us? 

On line at the supermarket 
waiting for the tally 
the blue numerals 
tattooed 
on the white skins 
of paper 
I read your open book 
of folly 
and take heart 
poet of my heart. 

The poet as a housewife 
Keeper of steak and liver 
keeper of keys locks razors 
keeper of blood and apples 
of breasts and angels 
Jesus and beautiful women 
keeper also of women 
who are not beautiful

you glide in from Cape Ann 
on your winged broomstick
the housewife's Pegasus. 

You are sweeping the skies clear 
of celestial rubbish. 
You are placing a child there 
a heart here
You are singing for your supper. 

Dearest wordmother and hungerteacher 
full professor of courage 
dean of women 
in my school of books 
thank you. 

I have checked out 
pounds of meat and cans of soup. 
I walk home laden 
light with writing you. 

Dear Colette 
I want to write to you 
about being a woman 
for that is what you write to me. 

I want to tell you how your face 
enduring after thirty forty fifty
hangs above my desk 
like my own muse. 

I want to tell you how your hands 
reach out from your books 
and seize my heart. 

I want to tell you how your hair 
electrifies my thoughts 
like my own halo. 

I want to tell you how your eyes 
penetrate my fear 
and make it melt. 

I want to tell you 
simply that I love youthough 
you are dead 
and I am still alive. 

Suicides and spinstersall 
our kind 

Even decorous Jane Austen 
never marrying 
and Sappho leaping 
and Sylvia in the oven 
and Anna Wickham Tsvetaeva Sara Teasdale 
and pale Virginia floating like Ophelia 
and Emily alone alone alone

But you endure and marry 
go on writing 
lose a husband gain a husband 
go on writing 
sing and tap dance 
and you go on writing 
have a child and still 
you go on writing 
love a woman love a man 
and go on writing. 
You endure your writing 
and your life. 

Dear Colette 
I only want to thank you 

for your eyes ringed 
with bluest paint like bruises 
for your hair gathering sparks 
like brush fire 
for your hands which never willingly 
let go 
for your years your child your lovers 
all your books 

Dear Colette 
you hold me 
to this life. 

Already six years past your age 
The steps in Rome 
the house near Hampstead Heath 
and all your fears 
that you might cease to be 
before your pen had gleaned

My dear dead friend 
you were the first to teach me 
how the dust could sing. 
I followed in your footsteps 
up the Heath. 
I listened hard 
for Lethe's nightingale. 

and now at 31 I want to live. 
Oblivion holds no adolescent charms. 
and all the souls of poets 
dead and gone
and all the Bards 
of Passion and Mirth
cannot make death
its echo its damp earth
resemble birth. 

You died in Rome
in faltering sunlightBernini's 
watery boat still sinking 
in the fountain in the square below. 
When Severn came to say 
the roses bloomed 
you did not glut thy sorrow
but you wept
you wept for them 
and for your posthumous life. 

and yet we all lead posthumous lives somehow. 
The broken lyre 
the broken lung 
the broken love. 
Our names are writ in newsprint 
if not water. 

do not breathe on me you cried 
it comes like ice. 

Last words. 
I cannot imagine mine. 
Perhaps some muttered dream 
some poem some curse. 

Three months past 25 
you lived on milk. 
They reeled you backward 
in the womb of love. 

A tepid February Roman Spring. 
Fruit trees in bloom 
and Hampstead still in snow 
and Fanny Brawne receives a hopeful note 
when you are two weeks dead. 

A poet's life 
always awaiting mail. 

For God's sake 
kick against the pricks 
There are not very many roses. 
Your life was like an hourglass 
with no sand. 
The words slid through 
and rested under glass 
the flesh decayed 
to moist Italian clay. 

At autopsy 
your lungs were wholly gone. 
Was that from too much singing? 
Too many rifts of ore? 
You spent your life breath 
breathing life in words. 

But words return no breath 
to those who write. 
Letters Life and Literary Remains
I find that I cannot exist without poetry 
O for a Life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts
What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth
We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us
Sancho will invent a Journey heavenwards as well as anybody
Poetry should be great and unobtrusive a thing which enters into one's soul. 
Why should we kick against the Pricks when we can walk on the Roses?' 
Axioms in philosophy are not axioms until they are proved upon our pulses
Until we are sick we understand not 
Sorrow is Wisdom
Wisdom is folly

Too wise 
and yet not wise enough 
at 25. 
Sick you understood 
and understanding 
were too weak to write. 

Proved on the pulse poetry. 

If sorrow is wisdom 
and wisdom is folly 
then too much sorrow 
is folly.

You claimed no lust for fame 
and yet your burned. 
The faint conceptions I have of poems to come brings 
the blood frequently into my forehead.

I burn like you 
until it often seems 
my blood will break 
the boundaries of my brain 
and issue forth in one tall fountain 
from my skull. 

A spume of blood from the forehead poetry. 

A plume of blood from the heart poetry. 

Blood from the lungs alizarin crimson words. 

I will not spoil my love of gloom 
by writing an Ode to Darkness

The blood turns dark 
it stiffens on the sheet. 
At night the childhood walls 
are streaked with blood
until the darkness seems awash with red 
and children sleep behind two bloodbranched lids. 

My imagination is a monastery 
and I am its monk 

At five and twenty 
very far from home 
death picked you up 
and sorted to a pip. 
and 15 decades later 
your words breathe 
syllables of blood. 

A strange transfusion 
for my feverish verse. 

I suck your breath 
your rhythms and your blood 
and all my fiercest dreams are sighed away. 

I send you love 
dear Keats 
I send you peace. 
Since flesh cannot stay 
we keep the breath aloft. 

Since flesh cannot stay 
we pass the words along. 

Dearest maninthemoon 
ever since our lunch of cheese 
and moonjuice 
on the far side of the sun 
I have walked the craters of New York 
a trail of slime 
ribboning between my legs 
a phosphorescent banner 
which is tied to you 
a beam of moonlight 
focused on your navel 
a silver chain 
from which my body dangles 
and my whole torso chiming 
like sleigh bells in a Russian novel. 

Dearest manonthemoon 
I used to fear moonlight 
thinking her my mother. 
I used to dread nights 
when the moon was full. 
I used to scream 
'Pull down the shade' 
because the moonface leered at me 
because I felt her mocking 
because my fear lived in me 
like rats in a wheel of cheese. 

You have eaten out my fear. 
You have licked 
the creamy inside of the moon. 
You have kissed 
the final crescent of my heart 
and made it full. 

At dusk Demeter 
becomes afraid 
for baby Persephone 
lost in that hell 
which she herself created 
with her love. 

Excess of love
the woman's curse 
the curse of loving 
that which causes pain 
the curse of bringing forth 
in pain 
the curse of bearing 
bearing always pain. 

Demeter pauses listening for her child
this fertile goddess 
with her golden hair bringing forth 
wheat and fruit and wildflowers 
kneehigh. 
This applebreasted goddess 
whose sad eyes 
will bless the frozen world 
bring spring again
all because she once 
walked through the night 
and loved a man halfdemon 
angel tongued 
who gave her 
everything she needed to be wise 
a daughter 
hell's black night 
then endless 
spring. 

Meathooks notebooks 
the whole city sky palely flaming 
and spectral bombs 
hitting that patch of river 
I see from my eastern window. 

The poets are dead the city dying. 
Anne Sylvia Keats 
with his passionate lungs 
Berryman jumping from the bridge and waving 
all the dreamers dead 
of their own dreams. 

Why have I stayed on as Horatio? 
Anne sends poems from the grave 
Sylvia letters. 
John Keats's ghostly cough 
comes through the wall board. 
What am I doing here? 
Why contend? 

I am a corpse who moves a pen that writes. 
I am a vessel for a voice that echoes. 
I write a novel and annihilate whole forests. 
I rearrange the cosmos by an inch. 

Driving me away 
is easier 
than saying 
goodbye

kissing the air 
the last syllable 
of truth 
being always 
two lips compressed 
around 
emptiness

the emptiness 
you dread 
yet return to 
as just punishment 
just reward. 

Who 
loved you 
so relentlessly? 
Who lost you 
in that howling void 
between infancy 
and death? 

It is punctuated 
by the warm bodies 
of women 
who hold you for a while 
then run 
down that echoing corridor 
doing 
as they are told. 

I am the Sphinx. 
I am the woman buried in sand 
up to her chin. 
I am waiting for an archaeologist 
to unearth me 
to dig out my neck and my nipples 
bare my claws 
and solve my riddle. 

No one has solved my riddle 
since Oedipus. 

I face the pyramids which rise 
like angular breasts 
from the dry body of Egypt. 
My fertile river is flowing down below
a lovely lower kingdom. 
Every woman should have a delta 
with such rich silt
brown as the buttocks 
of Nubian queens. 

O friend why have you come to Egypt? 
Aton and Yahweh 
are still feuding. 
Moses is leading his people 
and speaking of guilt. 
The voice out of the volcano 
will not be still. 

A religion of death 
a woman buried alive. 
For thousands of years 
the sand drifted over my head. 
My sex was a desert 
my hair more porous than pumice 
and nobody sucked my lips 
to make me tell. 

The pyramid breasts though huge 
will never sag. 
In the center of each one 
a king lies buried. 
In the center of each one 
a darkened chamber
a tunnel 
dead men's bones 
malignant gold. 

Every month 
the reminder of emptiness 
so that you are tuned 
to your bodyharp 
strung out on the harpsichord 
of all your nerves 
and hammered bloody blue 
as the crushed fingers 
of the woman pianist 
beaten by her jealous lover. 

Who was she? 
Someone I invented 
for this poem 
someone I imagined

Never mind 
she is me you

tied to that bodybeat 
fainting on the rack of blood 
moving to the metronome
empty empty empty. 

No use. 
The blood is thicker 
than the roots of trees 
more persistent than my poetry 
more baroque than her bruised music. 
It gilds the sky above the Virgin's head. 
It turns the lilies white. 

Try to run 
the blood still follows you. 

Swear off children 
seek a quiet room 
to practice your preludes and fugues. 
Under the piano 
the blood accumulates 
eventually it floats you both away. 

Give in. 
Babies cry and music is your life. 
Darling you were born to bleed 
or rock. 
and the heart breaks 
either way. 

In the poplars' lengthening shadows on this hill 
amid the rows of marigolds and earth 
and through the boxhedge labyrinth we walk 
together to the choiring twilight bells. 
Their fugue of echoes echoes through the hills 
and sings against this timestreaked flowering wall 
where breezes coax the potted lemon trees 
the pendant yellow fruit and shiny leaves. 
Beneath the flaming watercolor sky 
the cultivated terraced dropp of hill 
a gleaming city with its towers and domes 
the Arno shimmering as its drowns the sun. 

Chameleonlike I am tranformed by light 
and wine has blurred the edges of the night. 
What gifts I give on this or any night 
may be refracted in another light. 
You understnad this in a foreign tongue 
but vaguely for these things will not translate. 
I feel it in the cadence of your walk 
you are not whom moonlight can create. 
And you will think the loosening of these thighs 
the sudden urging whiteness of the throat 
are muted but distinctly pagan cries 
and in your triumph you will fairly gloat. 

Tonight the unplucked lemons almost gleam. 
And with their legs the crickets harmonize. 
The trees are rustling an uncertain hymn 
and unseen birds contribute trembling cries. 
When did the summer censor choiring things? 
We know the blood is brutal though it sings. 

On a darkening planet 
speeding 
toward our death 
we pierce a rosy cloud 
and hit clean air 
we glide above 
the red infernal smog 
we leave the mammon city 
far behind. 

Here  where the air is clear 
as nothing 
where cactus pads 
are prickly as stars 
where buffalo chips 
are gilded by the sun 
and the moon tastes like a peppermint
we land. 

'Have we flown to heaven?' 
I inquired 
and meant it. 
The airport was a leveled 
mountaintop. 
We took the cloudbank 
at a tilt 
and bumped the runway 
just ten degrees from crashing 
certain death. 

If I'm to die God 
let me die flying 
Fear is worse than death
I know that now. 
The cloudbanks of my life 
have silver linings. 
Beyond them 
cactus pads 
clear earth 
dear sky. 

You call me 
courageous 
I who grew up 
gnawing on books 
as some kids 
gnaw 
on bubble gum 

who married disastrously 
not once 
but three times 
yet have a lovely daughter 
I would not undo 
for all the dope 
in California. 

Fear was my element 
fear my contagion. 
I swam in it 
till I became 
immune. 
The plane takes off 
and I laugh aloud. 
Call me courageous. 

I am still alive. 

For all those who died
stripped naked shaved shorn. 

For all those who screamed 
in vain to the Great Goddess 
only to have their tongues 
ripped out at the root. 

For all those who were pricked racked broken on the wheel 
for the sins of their Inquisitors. 

For all those whose beauty 
stirred their torturers to fury 
and for all those whose ugliness did the same. 

For all those who were neither ugly nor beautiful 
but only women who would not submit. 

For all those quick fingers 
broken in the vise. 

For all those soft arms 
pulled from their sockets. 

For all those budding breasts 
ripped with hot pincers. 

For all those midwives killed merely for the sin 
of delivering man 
to an imperfect world. 

For all those witchwomen my sisters 
who breathed freer 
as the flames took them 

knowing as they shed 
their female bodies 
the seared flesh falling like fruit 
in the flames 
that death alone would cleanse them 
of the sin for which they died 

the sin of being born a woman 
who is more than the sum 
of her parts. 

the sky sinks its blue teeth 
into the mountains. 

Rising on pure will 

the lurch and liftoff 
the sudden swing 
into wide white snow 

I encourage the cable. 

Past the wind 
and crossed tips of my skis 
and the mauve shadows of pines 
and the spoor of bears 
and deer 

I speak to my fear 

rising riding 
finding myself 

the only thing 
between snow and sky 

the link 
that holds it all together. 

Halfway up the wire 
we stop 
slide back a little 
a whirr of pulleys. 

Astronauts circle above us today 
in the television blue of space. 

But the thin withers of alps 
are waiting to take us too 
and this might be the moon 

Friends this is a toy 
merely for reaching mountains 

merely 
for skiing down. 

and now we're dangling 
like charms on the same bracelet 

or upsidedown tightrope people 
a colossal circus 

or absurd winged walkers 
angels in animal fur 

with mittened hands waving 
and fear turning 

and the mountain 
like a fisherman 

reeling us all in. 

So we land 
on the windy peak 
touch skis to snow 
are married to our purple shadows 
and ski back down 
to the unimaginable valley 

leaving no footprints. 

Narrowing life because of the fears 
narrowing it between the dust motes 
narrowing the pink baby 
between the greenlimbed monsters 
and the drooling idiots 
and the ghosts of the Thalidomide infants 
narrowing hope 
always narrowing hope. 

Mother sits on one shoulder hissing 
Life is dangerous. 
Father sits on the other sighing 
Lucky you. 
Grandmother grandfather big sister 
You'll die if you leave us 
you'll die if you ever leave us. 

Sweetheart baby sister 
you'll die anyway 
and so will I. 
Even if you walk the wide greensward 
even if you 
and your beautiful big belly 
embrace the world of men and trees 
even if you moan with pleasure 
and smoke the sweet grass 
and feast on strawberries in bed 
you'll die anyway
wide or narrow 
you're going to die. 

As long as you're at it 
die wide. 
Follow your belly to the green pasture. 
Lie down in the sun's dapple. 
Life is not as dangerous 
as mother said. 
It is more dangerous 
more wide. 

Already six years past your age

You sleep in the darkness 
you with the back I love 
and the gift of sleeping 
through my noisy nights of poetry. 

I have taken other men into my thoughts 
since I met you. 
I have loved parts of them. 
But only you sleep on through the darkness 
like a mountain where my house is planted 
like a rock on which my temple stands 
like a great dictionary holding every word
even some 
I have never spoken. 

You breathe. 
The pages of your dreams are riffled

'Hello. Hello. Hello. 
You're getting there' it says 
'step by step.' 

Legs aren't stars 
which sputter out 
and go on gleaming anyway. 
I've lived of course 
with phantom limbs 

but this fracture 
does not point to 
amputation. No. 
It hisses at something 
much more final. 

Skin lantern 
necklace of teeth

are in revolt against us. 
We keep them down

So they've got time to bide. 
Meanwhile spreadeagle 
on these crutches a cripple 
sucking the ground with rubber 

nipples or else a knight 
up to my ass in armor 
I limp and swing my way 

across the street 
and up the steps 

moving here and now 
step by step 
towards the future 
that incurable 
fracture. 

I am in love with my womb 
and jealous of it. 

I cover it tenderly 
with a little pink hat 
a sort of yarmulke 
to protect it from men. 

Then I listen for the gentle ping 
of the ovary
a sort of cupid's bow 
released. 
I am proud of that. 
and the spot of blood 
in the little hat 
and the egg so small 
I cannot see it 
though I pray to it. 

I imagine the inside 
of my womb to be 
the color of poppies 
and bougainvillea 
though I have never seen it. 

But I fear the barnacle 
which might latch on 
and not let go 
and fear the monster 
who might grow 
to bite the flowers 
and make them swell and bleed. 

So I keep my womb empty 
and full of possibility. 

Each month 
The blood sheets down 
like good red rain. 

I am the gardener. 
Nothing grows without me. 

Because I am here 
anchoring you 
to the passionate darkness 
you gaze out the window 
at the light. 

My love is the thing 
that frees you 
to follow your eyes 

as your love 
a sword made of moonlight 
and blood 
and smelling of sex 
and salt marshes 
frees me to gaze 
with a calm inward 
eye. 

In all your frenzied searching 
you never stood 
calmly at the window. 

But now the sea 
the city and the sky 
are all seen 
as if from a perch 
at the edge of the cosmos 
where I sit behind you 
gazing 
at the fire. 

If it is impossible to promise 
absolute fidelity 
this is because 
we learn so much geography 
from the shifting of one body 
on another. 

If it is impossible to promise 
absolute fidelity 
this is because 
we learn so much history 
from the lying of one body 
on another. 

If it is impossible to promise 
absolute fidelity 
this is because 
we learn so much psychology 
from the dreaming of one body 
of another. 

Life writes so many letters 
on the naked bodies of lovers. 
What a tattoo artist 
What an ingenious teacher 

Is it any wonder we appear 
like schoolchildren dreaming 
naked 
and anxious to learn? 

I looked at the book. 
It will stand I thought. 
Not a palace 
built by a newspaper czar 
nor a mud hovel 
that the sea will soften 
but a good house of words 
near the sea 
with everything plumb. 
That is the most I can ask. 

I have cut the wood myself 
from my own forests 
I have sanded it smooth 
with the grain. 
I have left knotholes 
for the muse to whistle through 
old siren that she is. 

At least the roof does not leak. 
and the fireplace is small 
but it draws. 
The wind whips the house 
but it stands. 
and the waves lick 
the pilings 
with their tongues 
but at least they do not suck me 
out to sea. 
The sea is wordless 
but it tries to talk to us. 
We carpenters are also translators. 
We build with sounds with whispers and with wind. 
We try to speak the language of the sea. 

We want to build to last 
yet change forever. 
We want to be as endless as the sea. 
and yet she mocks us 
with her barnacle and rust stains 
she tells us what we build will also fall. 

Our words are grains of sand 
our walls are wood 
our windowpanes are sprayed with solemn salt. 
We whisper as we build Forever please
by which we mean at least for thirty years. 

We have a small sculpture of Henry James on our terrace in New York 
City. 

Nothing would surprise him. 
The beast in the jungle was what he sawEdith 
Wharton's obfuscating older brother

He fled the demons 
of Manhattan 
for fear they would devour 
his inner ones 
the ones who wrote the books 
and silence the stifled screams 
of his protagonists. 

To Europe 
like a wandering JewWASP 
that he wasbut 
with the Jew's 
outsider's hunger

face pressed up 
to the glass of sex 
refusing every passion 
but the passion to write 
the words grew 
more and more complex 
and convoluted 
until they utterly imprisoned him 
in their fairytale brambles. 

Language for me 
is meant to be 
a transparency 
clear water gleaming 
under a covered bridge
I love his spiritual sister 
because she snatched clarity 
from her murky history. 

Tormented New Yorkers both 
but she journeyed 
to the heart of lightdid 
he? 

She took her friends on one last voyage 
through the isles of Greece 
on a yacht chartered with her royaltiesa 
rich girl proud to be making her own money. 

The light of the Middle Sea 
was what she sought. 
All denizens 
of this demonic city caught 
between pitch and black 
long for the light. 

But she found it 
in a few of her books 
while Henry James 
discovered 
what he had probably 
started with 
that beast that jungle 
that solipsistic scream. 

He did not join her 
on that final cruise. 
He was on his own final cruise. 
Did he want to? 
I would wager yes. 

I look back with love and sorrow 
at them bothdear 
teachersbut 
she shines like Miss Liberty 
to Emma Lazarus' hordes 
while he gazes within 
always at his own 
impenetrable jungle. 

My broom 
with its tufts of roses 
beckoning at the black 
with its crown of thistles 
prickling the sky 
with its carved crescents 
winking silverly 
at Diana 
with its thick brush 
of peacock feathers 
sweeping the night 
with its triangle 
of glinting fur. 

I ride 
over the roofs 
of doom. 
I ride 
while he thinks me safe 
in our bed. 
My forehead 
he thinks that scraggly 
other broom 
my hips that staff 
my sex that stump 
of blackthorn 
and of twine. 

Ah I will ride 
over the skies
orange as apricots 

a flip through BRIDE's 

The silver spoons 
were warbling 
their absurd musical names 
when drawing back 
her veil illusion 

she stepped into 
the valentineshaped bathtub 
and slid her perfect bubbles 
in between 
the perfect bubbles. 

Oh brilliantly complex as 
compound interest 
her diamond gleams 
Forever on the edge 
of a weddingcakeshaped bed. 

What happens there 
is merely icing since 
a snakepit of dismembered 
douchebag coils all writhing 
awaits her on the tackier back pages. 

Dearly beloved let's hymn 
her qnd Daddy down 
the aisle with 
epithalamia composed 
for Ovulen ads 

It's the right 
of every married couple 
to wait to space to wait' 
and antistrophes 
appended by the Pope. 

Good Griefthe groom 
Has she or we 
entirely forgot? 
She'll dream him whole. 
American type with ushers 

halfbacks headaches drawbacks backaches 
and borrowed suit 
stuffed in a borrowed face 
or was it the reverse? 
Oh well. Here's he 

part coy pajamas 
part mothered underwear 
and of course 
an enormous prick 
full of money. 

He still wears the glass skin of childhood. 
Under his hands the stones turn mirrors. 
His eyes are knives. 

Who froze the ground to his feet? 
Who locked his mouth into an horizon? 
Why does the sun set when we touch? 

I look for the lines between the silences. 
He looks only for the silences. 

Cram this page under his tongue. 
Open him as if for surgery. 
Let the red knife love slide in 

All night he lies awake tuning the sky 
tuning the night with its fat crackle of static 
with its melancholy love songs crooning 
across the rainy air above Verdun 
and the autobahn's blue suicidal dawn. 

Wherever he lives there is the same unwomaned bed 
the ashtrays overflowing their reproaches 
his stained fingers on the tuning bar fishing 
for her voice in a deep mirrorless pond 
for the tinsel and elusive fish 
brighter than pennies in water and more wished uponthe 
coppercolored daughter of the pond god. 

He casts for her the tuning bar his rod 
but only longdead lovers with their griefs 
haunt him in Piaf's voice
as if a voice could somehow only die 
when it was sung out utterly. 

He finally lies down and drowns the light 
but the taste of her rises brackish 
from the long dark water of her illness 
and his grief is terrible as drowning 
when he reaches for the radio again. 

In the daytime you hardly know him 
he walks in a borrowed calm. 

You cannot sense 
his desperation in the dawn 
when the abracadabras of the birds 
conjure another phantom day. 

He favors cities which blaze all night 
hazy mushrooms of light under the blue 
and blinking eyes of jets. 
But when the lamps across the way go under 
and the floorboards settle 

and the pipes fret like old men gargling
he is alone with his mouthful of ghosts 
his tongue bitter with her unmourned death 
and the terrible drowning. 

I watch from my blue window 
knowing he does not trust me 
though I know him as I know my ghosts 
though I know his drowning 
though since that night when all harmony broke for me 
I have been trying to tune the sky. 

A bed a telephone the cord 
to the world 
beyond the womb 
Here lovers meet have met 
will meet again behind different faces 
while the icy picures 
look on 
seeing nothing. 
Hotel rooms see nothing. 

Business transacted 
prostitutes killed 
marriages silently shaken 
what happens here 
is off the record 
there is no record 
when the sheets 
are changed 
every night 
for other guests. 

and you my darling 
my lover my reader 
ultimately 
myself 
why are you hungering so 
why are you opening 
abysses in yourself 
before you rush off 
to the next appointment? 

Eternity is just 
a hotel room
deluxe or seedy 
as the fates allow 
lonely as the loneliest 
onenight stand 
and with no telephone. 

Or is it the body? 
Is the body the hotel room after all? 
O let us inhabit it amply crying 
and screaming and embracing 
before we 
check out. 

When the devil brings him 
like a Christmas puppy 
examine his downy fur and smell 
his small paws for the scent 
of sulphur. 

Is he a child of hell? 
O clearly those soft brown eyes 
speak volumes 
of deviltry. 
O surely those small pink teats 
could suckle witches. 
O those floppy ears 
hear only the devil's hissing. 
O that small pink tongue 
will lick and lick at your heart 
until only Satan may 
slip in. 

A fuzzy white dog? 
Name him Catch. 
A little black kitten? 
She is Jamara. 
A tiny brown rabbit? 
Call her Pyewackett. 

Beware beware
the soft the innocent 
the kingdom of cuddly ones
All these 
expose you to the jealous tongues 
of neighbors' flames 
all these 
are the devil's snares 

Familiars familiars
there is hellfire lurking 
in the softest fur 
brimstone in the pinkest tongue 

I am happiest 
near the ocean 
where the changing light 
reminds me of my death 
and the fact that it need not be fatal

yet I perch here 
in the midst of the city 
where the traffic dulls my senses 
where my ears scream at sirens 
where transistor radio blasts 
invade my poems 
like alien war chants. 

But I never walk 
the streets of New York 
without hoping for the end 
of the world. 

How many years 
before the streets return to flowers? 
How many centuries 
before the towers fall? 

In my mind's eye 
New York falls to ruins. 
Butterflies alight upon stones 
and poppies spring 
out of the asphalt fields. 

Why do I stay here 
when I love the ocean? 
Because the ocean lulls me 
with its peace. 
Eternity is coming soon enough. 
As monks sleep 
in their own coffins 
I live in New York. 

I sit at my desk alone 
as I did on many Sunday 
afternoons when you came 
back to me 
your arms aching for me 
though they smelled 
of other women 
and your sweet head bowed 
for me to rub 
and your heart bursting 
with things to tell me 
and your hair 
and your eyes 
wild. 

We would embrace 
on the carpet 
and leave 
the imprint of our bodies 
on the floor. 
My back is still sore 
where you pressed me 
into the rug 
a sweet soreness I would never 
lose. 

I think of you always 
on Sunday afternoons 
and I try to conjure you 
with these words 
as if you might 
come back to me 
at twilight 
but you are never coming back 
never. 

The truth is 
you no longer exist. 
Oh you walk the world 
sturdily enough 
one foot in front 
of the other. 
But the lover you were 
the tender shoot 
springing within me 
trusting me with your dreams 
has hardened 
into fear and cynicism. 

Betrayal does that 
betrays the betrayer. 

I want to hate you 
and I cannot. 
But I cannot 
love you either. 

It is our old love 
I love 
as one loves 
certain images 
from childhood 
shards 
shining in 
the street 
in the shit. 

Shards of light 
in the darkness. 

I sleep with double pillows since you're gone. 
Is one of them for youor is it you? 
My bed is heaped with books of poetry. 
I fall asleep on yellow legal pads. 

Oh the orgies in stationery stores 
The love of printer's ink and think new pads 
A poet has to fall in love to write. 
Her bed is heaped with papers or with men. 

I keep your pillow pressed down with my books. 
They leave an indentation like your head. 
If I cannot have you here I'll take cold typeand 
words the warmest things there are
but you. 

I try to keep 
falling in love 
if only to keep 
death 
at bay. 

I know 
that the burned 
witches 
that the seared flesh 
of the enemy

O we are all 
each other's 
enemies 
even sometimes those 
who lately 
were 
lovers

are not 
to be reconstituted 
nor healed 

by my 
falling 
in love 

and yet 
here is 
the paradox 

love drives 
the poem

and the poem 
is 
hope. 

If God is a dog drowsing 
contemplating 
the quintessential dogginess 
of the universe of the whole 
canine race why are we 
uneasy? 

No dog I know 
would hurl thunderbolts 
or plant plague germs 
or shower us with darts 
of pox or gonococci. 
No. He lies on his back 
awaiting 
the cosmic belly rub. 
He wags his tail signifying 
universal love. 
He frolics and cavorts 
because he has just 
taken a galactic shit 
and found it good. 
All dogs are blessed 
they live in the now. 

But God is all too human. 
Somehow we have spelled his name 
wrong got it backward 
aroused his growl. 

God drowses 
like a lazy old man 
bored 
with our false 
alarms. 

If it is only for the taking off
the velvet cloak 
the ostrich feather boa 
the dress which slithers to the floor 
with the sound of strange men sighing 
on imagined street corners

If it is only for the taking off
the red lace bra 
with rosewindows of breasts 
the red lace pants 
with dark suggestion 
of Venus' first name 
the black net stockings 
cobwebby as fate 
criscrossed like our lives 
the silver sandals 
glimmering as rain

clothes are necessary. 
Oh bulky barrier between soul and soul 
soul and self
how it comforts us 
to take you down 
How it heartens us to strip you off 
and this is no matter of fashion. 

In the glassbottomed boat 
of our lives we putter along 
gazing at the other world 
under the sea
that world of flickering 
yellowtailed fish 
of deadly moray eels of sea urchins 
like black stars 
that devastate great brains 
of coral 
of fish the color 
of blue neon 
and fish the color 
of liquid silver 
made by Indians 
exterminated 
centuries ago. 

We pass we pass 
always looking down. 
The fish do not 
look up at us 
as if they knew 
somehow 
their world 
for the eternal one 
ours for 
the merely timebound. 

The engine sputters. 
Our guidea sweet 
black boy with skin 
the color of molten chocolate
asks us of the price of jeans 
and karate classes 
in the States. 
Surfboards too 
delight him and 
skateboards. 

He wants to sail sail sail 
not putter 
through the world. 

and so do we 
so do we 
wishing for the freedom 
of the fish 
beneath the reef 
wishing for the crevices 
of sunken ship 
with its rusted eyeholes 
its great ribbed hull 
its rotted rudder 
its bright propeller 
tarnishing beneath the sea. 

'They sunk this ship 
on purpose' 
says our guide
which does not surprise 
us 
knowing how life 
always imitates 
even the shabbiest 
art. 
Our brains forged 
in shark and seawreck epics 
we fully expect to see 
a wreck like this one 
made on purpose 
for our eyes. 

But the fish swim on 
intimating death 
intimating outer space 
and even the oceans 
within the body 
from which we come. 

The fish are uninterested 
in us. 

What hubris to think 
a shark concentrates 
as much on us 
as we on him 

The creatures of the reef 
spell death spell life 
spell eternity 
and still we putter on 
in our leaky little boat 
halfway there 
halfway there. 

Sweet muse 
with bitter milk 
I have lain 
between your breasts 
put my ear 
to your seashellwhispering navel 
and strained the salty marshes 
of your sex 
between my milk teeth. 
Then I've slept at last 
my teeming head 
against your rocking thigh. 

Gentle angry mother 
poetry 
where could I turn 
from the terror of the night 
but to your sweet maddening 
ambivalence? 
Where could I rest 
but in your hurricane? 
who would always take me home 
but you 
sweeping off the sooty stoop 
of your windfilled shack 
on the edge 
of the volcano? 

Black ship of night 
sailing through the world 
and the moon an orange slice 
tangy to the teeth 
of lovers who lie 
under it 
sucking it. 

Somewhere there are palm trees 
somewhere the sea 
bluely gathers itself up 
and lets itself fall again 
into green 
somewhere the spangles 
of light on the ocean 
dazzle the eyes 
but here in the midnight city 
the black ship of night 
has docked 
for a long dark stay 
and even the citrus moon 
with its pockets of juice 
cannot sweeten the dark. 

Then the snow begins 
whirling over the Pole 
gathering force over Canada 
sprinkling the Great Lakes with sugar 
which drowns in their deep black cups 
it is drawn to the spires of New York 
and the flurries come 
scampering at first 
lighthearted crystalline white 
but finally 
sucked into the city 
as into a black hole 
in space. 

The sky is suddenly pink
pink as flesh breasts 
babies' bottoms. Night is 
day day is whiter than the desert 
the city stops like a heart 
pigeons dip and veer 
and come to rest 
under the snowhatted 
watertanks. 

The women he has had are all faces 
without eyes. 
He has entered them blind 
as a cut worm. 
He has swum their oceans 
like a wounded fish 
looking for home. 

At nights when he cannot sleep 
he dreams of weaving 
backward up that river 
where the banks 
are fringed with mouths 
and weedy hair 
grows amid the dark crusts 
of ancient blood. 

Tonight he is afraid and lonely 
in a city of meat and knives. 
I would go under his knife 
and move so willingly 
that his heart 
might turn to butter 
in his mouth. 

You gave me the child 
that seamed my belly 
and stitched up my life. 

You gave me one book of love poems 
five years of peace 
and two of pain. 

You gave me darkness light laughter 
and the certain knowledge 
that we someday die. 

You gave me seven years 
during which the cells of my body 
died and were reborn. 

Now we have died 
into the limbo of lost loves 
that wreckage of memories 
tarnishing with time 
that litany of losses 
which grows longer with the years 
as more of our friends 
descend underground 
and the list of our loved dead 
outstrips the list of the living. 

Knowing as we do 
our certain doom 
knowing as we do 
the rarity of the gifts we gave 
and received 
can we redeem 
our love from the limbo 
dust it off like a fine sea trunk 
found in an attic 
and now more valuable 
for its age and rarity 
than a shining new one? 
Probably not. 
This page is spattered 
with tears that streak the words 
lose losses limbo. 

I stand on a ledge in hell 
still howling for our love 

You can be hurt 
because you want too much 
because in your face it says 
love me nurture me 
because in your teeth it says 
sugar flows to us 
because in your tongue it says 
drive in the spike. 

You can be hurt 
because you care too much 
because your ribs swing out like shutters 
and your heart 
glows like a night light. 

You can be hurt 
because you need too much 
because your skin comes off in streamers 
and your veins 
twang like guitar strings. 
You can be hurt that way. 

You made your head 
a wind tunnel for death. 
You made your womb 
the world's confessional. 
You made your heart 
a lump of burning clay. 

You me
we can be hurt that way. 

We used to strike sparks 
off each other. 
Our eyes would meet 
or our hands 
and the blue lightning of love 
would sear the air. 

Now we are soft. 
We loll 
in the same sleepy bed 
skin of my skin 
hair of my head 
sweat of my sweat
you are kin 
brother and mother 
all in one 
husband lover muse and comforter 
I love you even better 
without sparks. 

We are pebbles in the tide 
rolling against each other. 
The surf crashes above us 
the irregular pulse 
of the ocean drives our blood 
but we are growing smooth 
against each other. 

Are we living happily ever after? 
What will happen 
to my love of cataclysms? 
My love of sparks and fire 
my love of ice? 

Fellow pebble 
let us roll 
against each other. 
Perhaps the sparks are clearer 
under water. 

Unable to bear 
the uncertainty 
of the future 
we consulted seers 
mediums stock market gurus 
psychics who promised 
happiness on this 
or another planet 
astrologists of love 
seekers of the Holy Grail. 

Looking for certainty 
we asked for promises 
lover's knots pledges rings 
certificates deeds of ownership 
when it was always enough 
to let your hand 
pass over my body 
your eyes find the depths of my own 
and the wind pass over our faces 
as it will pass 
through our bones 
sooner than we think. 

The current is love 
is poetry 
the blood beat 
in the thighs 
the electrical charge 
in the brain. 

Our long leap 
into the unknown 
began nearly 
a half century ago 
and is almost 
over. 

I think of the 
amphorae of stored honey 
at Paestum 
far outlasting 
their Grecian eaters 
or of the furniture 
in a pharoah's tomb 
on which 
no one sits. 

Trust the wind 
my lover 
and the water. 

They have the 
answers 
to all your questions 

and mine. 

You open to me 
a little 
then grow afraid 
and close again 
a small boy 
fearing to be hurt 
a toe stubbed 
in the dark 
a finger cut 
on paper. 

I think I am free 
of fears 
enraptured abandoned 
to the call 
of the Bacchae 
my own siren 
tied to my own 
mast 
both Circe 
and her swine. 

But I too 
am afraid 
I know where 
life leads. 

The impulse 
to join 
to confess all 
is followed 
by the impulse 
to renounce 

and loveimperishable 
lovemust 
die 
in order 
to be reborn. 

We come 
to each other 
tentatively 
veterans of other 
wars 
divorce warrants 
in our hands 
which we would beat 
into blossoms. 

But blossoms 
will not withstand 
our beatings. 

We come 
to each other 
with hope 
in our handsthe 
very thing 
Pandora kept 
in her casket 
when all the ills 
and woes of the world 
escaped. 

Most beautiful of poisons 
borderplant 
wearing your small green cowl 
little friar little murderer 
aconitine flows 
from your roots 
to your deep purple flowers 
small deceiver 
centerpiece 
for a poisonous 
feast. 

A few leaves 
in the salad 
a few seeds 
in the soup 
a thick root 
to flavor 
the stockand 
it is all over. 

Let the lover beware 
who buys you 
for love philters. 
The dose is deceptive. 
One pinch leads to passion 
but two will surely lead 
to death. 

Yet you twinkle 
little blue bell 
at the edge 
of the garden 
wearing no warning 
about your slim green neck. 

Wolfsbane Friar's cap 
Chariot of Venus
how many may claim 
to be poisonous 
head to toe? 

That honor
Friar Death
belongs to you. 

Exploring each other's 
depths 
that surge of connection 
which makes the world 
seem sane 
that exchange of spirit 
in the guise of flesh 
that morning hallelujah 
that hook 
to eternity

All day I bear you 
between my legs 
and in my heart. 
Powered by your love 
there is no hill 
too high to climb 
no paragraph 
I cannot write 
no hosanna 
I cannot howl

Shall we wear it down 
with habit? 
Shall that combustible connection 
become in time homier 
than fresh bread 
nourishing but unsurprising? 

O my lover 
meet me in the hollow 
of a red thigh 
by mountains 
which resemble 
spouting cocks
We will keep 
the madness fresh
the red madness 
that keeps us 
sane. 

Ash falls on the roof 
of my house. 

I have cursed you enough 
in the lines of my poems 
and between them 
in the silences which fall 
like ashflakes 
on the watertank 
from a smogbound sky. 

I have cursed you 
because I remember 
the smell of Joy 
on a sealskin coat 
and because I feel 
more abandoned than a baby seal 
on an ice floe red 
with it's mother's blood. 

I have cursed you 
as I walked and prayed 
on a concrete terrace 
high above the street 
because whatever I pulled down 
with my bruised hand 
from the bruising sky 
whatever lovely plum 
came to my mouth 
you envied 
and spat out. 

Because you saw me in your image 
because you favored me 
you punished me. 

It was only a form of you 
my poems were seeking. 
Neither of us knew. 

For years 
we lived together in a single skin. 

We shared fur coats. 
We hated each other 
as the soul hates the body 
for being weak 
as the mind hates the stomach 
for needing food 
as one lover hates the other. 

I kicked 
in the pouch of your theories 
like a baby kangaroo. 

I believed you 
on Marx on Darwin 
on Tolstoy and Shaw. 
I said I loved Pushkin 
you loved him. 
I vowed Monet 
was better than Bosch. 

Who cared? 

I would have said nonsense 
to please you 
and frequently did. 

This took the form 
of course 
of fighting you. 

We fought so gorgeously 

We fought like one boxer 
and his punching bag. 
We fought like mismatched twins. 
We fought like the secret sharer 
and his shade. 

Now we are apart. 
Time does not heal 
the baby to the womb. 
Separateness is real 
and keeps on growing. 

One by one the mothers 
dropp away 
the lovers leave 
the babies outgrow clothes. 

Some get insomnia the 
poet's disease and 
sit up nights 
nursing 
at the nipples 
of their pens. 

I have made hot milk 
and kissed you where you are. 
I have cursed my curses. 
I have cleared the air. 
and now I sit here writing 
breathing you. 

Mute marriages 
the tenton block of ice 
obstructing the throat the heart 
the red filter of the liver 
the clogged life. 

It is a glacier 
in which frozen children swim 
ground round with boulders 
pebbles bits of stone 
from other ice ages. 

Here a lapis glitters 
here a shard of bottle glass
valuables and junk 
the history of a house 
told in its garbage cans 
the history of a life 
in its nightmares. 

Speak the dream. 
Follow the red thread 
of the images. 
Defrost the glacier 
with the live heat 
of your breath 
propelled by the heart's 
explosion. 

My death 
looks exactly like me. 
She lives to my left 
at exactly an arm's length. 
She has my face hair hands 
she ages 
as I grow older. 

Sometimes at night 
my death awakens me 
or else appears in dreams 
I did not write. 
Sometimes a sudden wind 
blows from nowhere 
and I look left 
and see my death. 

Alive I write 
with my right hand only. 
When I am dead 
I shall write with my left. 

But later I will have to write 
through others. 
I may appear 
to future poets 
as their deaths. 

My love is too much
it embarrasses you
blood poems babies 
red needs that telephone 
from foreign countries 
black needs that spatter 
the pages 
of your white papery heart. 

You would rather have a girl 
with simpler needs 
lunch sex undemanding 
loving 
dinner wine bed 
the occasional blowjob 
and needs that are never 
red as gaping wounds 
but cool and blue 
as television screens 
in tract houses. 

Oh my love 
those simple girls 
with simple needs 
read my books too. 

They tell me they feel 
the same as I do. 

They tell me I transcribe 
the language of their hearts. 
They tell me I translate 
their mute unspoken pain 
into the white light 
of language. 

Oh love 
no love 
is ever wholly undemanding. 

It can pretend coolness 
until the pain comes 
until the first baby comes 
howling her own infant need 
into a universe 
that never summoned her. 

The love you seek 
cannot be found 
except in the white pages 
of recipe books. 

It is cooking you seek 
not love 
cooking with sex coming after 
cool sex 
that speaks to the penis alone 
and not the howling chaos 
of the heart. 

Mirrormad 
he photographed reflections 
sunstorms in puddles 
cities in canals 

double portraits framed 
in sunglasses 
the fat phantoms who dance 
on the flanks of cars. 

Nothing caught his eye 
unless it bent 
or glistered 
over something else. 

He trapped clouds in bottles 
the way kids 
trap grasshoppers. 
Then one misty day 

he was stopped 
by the windshield. 
Behind him 
an avenue of trees 

before him 
the mirror of that scene. 
He seemed to enter 
what in fact he left. 

Living in a house 
near the Black Forest 
without any clocks 
she is begun 

to listen to the walls. 
Her neighbors have clocks 
not one 
but twenty clocks apiece. 

Sometimes 
a claque of clocks 
applauds 
the passing of each day. 

Listen to the walls 
and wind your watch. 
Poor love poor love 
have they caught you 

by the pendulum? 
Do they think they have
got you stopped? 
Have you 

already gathered how 
living near the Black Forest 
she gets by 
on cups of borrowed time? 

Testing the soul's mettle 
the frost heaves 
holes in the roads 
to the heart 
the glass forest 
raises up its branches 
to praise all things 
that catch the light 
then melt. 
The forest floor is white 
but here and there a boulder rises 
with its glacial arrogance 
and brooks that bubble 
under the sheets of ice 
remind us that the tundra of the soul 
will soften 
just a little 
towards the spring. 

Nobody believes in love
not even me. 

Love is the thing 
you wait 
to end. 

Love is the thing 
that will not 
cannot work. 

Love is the thing 
they warn you of
the dire parents 
the friends 
with their dead 
marriages 
their crushed hopes. 

Nothing crushes hope 
but the will to make 
the heart 
like rock. 

That will is strong. 

The rockheart stands 
when the love songs crumble 
their yellowing sheet music 
kept in a drawer 
their sweet hugs and tugs 
forgotten 
like the merest air 
of an old New England 
spring. 

Spring comes again 
and again 
and the rockhearts 
feel the sap rising 
thinking it is sex 
thinking the glands alone 
cause this tumult 
to the innards 
this hidden spring 
this secret river 
which is hope. 

Let them put it down 
to sex 

Let them say 
we worship Dionysus 
Bacchus Pan 
but not the proper 
gods. 

Let them have 
the proper gods
Jahweh 
with his heart like rock 
Christ with his blood 
and thorns 
Mammon with his stock certificates 
his rates his rates 
his bull markets 
and his late rallies. 

We are rallying 
alone. 
We spit our love 
into the wind. 

Nobody can bear 
to watch 
our love. 

Except the muse 
who smiles 
and sends 
these 
poems. 

On the first night 
of the full moon 
the primeval sack of ocean 
broke 
and I gave birth to you 
little woman 
little carrot top 
little turnedup nose 
pushing you out of myself 
as my mother 
pushed 
me out of herself 
as her mother did 
and her mother's mother before her 
all of us born 
of woman. 

I am the second daughter 
of a second daughter 
of a second daughter 
but you shall be the first. 
You shall see the phrase 
second sex 
only in puzzlement 
wondering how anyone 
except a madman 
could call you second 
when you are so splendidly 
first 
conferring even on your mother 
firstness vastness fullness 
as the moon at its fullest 
lights up the sky. 

Now the moon is full again 
and you are four weeks old. 
Little lion lioness 
yowling for my breasts 
rowling at the moon 

how I love your lustiness 
your red face demanding 
your hungry mouth howling 
your screams your cries 
which all spell life 
in large letters 
the color of blood. 

You are born a woman 
for the sheer glory of it 
little redhead beautiful screamer. 
You are no second sex 
but the first of the first 
and when the moon's phases 
fill out the cycle 
of your life 
you will crow 
for the joy 
of being a woman 
telling the pallid moon 
to go drown herself 
in the blue ocean 
and glorying glorying glorying 
in the rosy wonder 
of your sunshining wondrous 
self. 

Love death sleeping 
with somebody else's husband 
or wifethis 
is what poetry is 
aboutEskimo Aztec 
or even Italian 
Rinascimento 
or even the high falutin Greeks 
or noble RomanO's. 

O the constant turmoil 
of the human species
beds graves Spring with its 
familiar rosebuds the wrong beds 
the wrong graves wars 
unremembered and boundaries gained 
only to be lost and lost 
again 
and lost roses whose lost 
petals 
reminded poets to carpe carpe 
diem with whoever's wife 
or husband happened to 
be handiest 

O Turmoil and Confusion
you are my Muses 
O longing for a world 
without death without beds 
divided by walls between houses 
All the beds float out to sea 
All the dying lovers wave 
to the other dying lovers 
One of them writes on his mistress's skin as he floats. 

He is the poet. 
Not for this 
will his life be spared. 

Male? 
Female? 
God does not care 
about sex 
and the long treeshaded avenue 
toward death. 

God says 
the worm is as beautiful 
as the apple it eats 
and the apple as lovely 
as the thick trunk 
of the tree 
and the trunk of the tree 
no more beautiful 
than the air 
surrounding it. 

God does not care 
about the battle 
between the sexes 
with which we amuse ourselves 
on our way toward death. 

God says 
there are no sexes 
and still we amuse ourselves 
arguing about whether or not 
She is male 
or He 
female. 

On the first night 
of the full moon 
the primeval sack of ocean

and I gave birth to you

Spring rainbows 
ordinary miracles 
about which 
nothing new can be said. 

The stars on a clear night 
of a New England winter 
the soft air of the islands 
along the old 
Spanish Main 
pirate gold shining 
in the palm 
the odor of roses 
to the lover's nose

There is no more poetry 
to be written 
of these things. 
The rainbow's sudden revelationbehold 
The clich√© is true 
What can one say 
but that? 

So too 
with you little heart 
little miracle 

but you are 
no less miracle 
for being ordinary. 

Rising in the morning 
like warm bread 
from a bed 
in America 
the aroma 
of my baking 
reaches you 
in Italy 
rocking in your boat 
near the Ponte Longo 
cutting through the glitter 
of yesterday's moonlight 
on your sunstruck 
canal. 

My delicious baker
it is you 
who have made 
this hot bread 
rise. 
It is you 
who have split the loaf 
and covered it with butter. 

I prayed to the moon 
streaking the still lagoon 
with her skyblue manna 
I prayed for you 
to sail into my life 
parting the waters 
making them whole. 

And here you come 
half captain half baker


and the warm aroma of bread 
crosses 
the ocean 
we share. 

The first snow of the year 
and you lying between my breasts 
in my husband's house 
and the snow gently rising in my throat 
like guilt 
and the windows frosted over 
as if etched by acid. 

You have come from the desert 
and have left a little sand 
between my legs 
where it rubs and rubs 
and secretes a milky fluid 
finally a poem 
or a pearl. 

I am your oyster shell 
your mother of pearl 
gleaming like oil on water 
for two hours on a snowy day. 

'Poets fall in love to write about it' 
I said in my brittle way 
and told you about other loves to tempt you 
and heard your siren songs of old affairs. 

I fall in love as a kind of research project. 
You fall in love as some men go to war. 

What tanks 
What bombs 
What storms of index cards 

I am binding up your legs with carbon ribbon. 
I tied you to the bed with paper chains. 

I have known the imperial power of secretaries 
the awesome indifference of receptionists 
I have been intimidated by desk and typewriter 
by the silver jaws of the stapler 
and the lecherous kiss of the mucilage 
and the unctuousness of rubber cement 
before it dries. 

I have been afraid of telephones 
have put my mouth to their stale tobacco breath 
have been jarred to terror 
by their jangling midnight music 
and their sudden blackness 
even when they are white. 

I have been afraid in elevators 
amid the satin hiss of cables 
and the silky lisping of air conditioners 
and the helicopter blades of fans. 
I have seen time killed in the office jungles 
of undeclared war. 

My fear has crept into the paper guillotine 
and voyaged to the Arctic Circle of the water cooler. 
My fear has followed me into the locked Ladies Room 
and down the iron fire stairs 
to the postage meter. 

I have seen the mailroom women like lost letters 
frayed around the edges. 
I have seen the Xerox room men 
shuffling in and out among each other 
like cards in identical decks. 

I have come to tell you I have survived. 
I bring you chains of paperclips instead of emeralds. 

I bring you lottery tickets instead of poems. 
I bring you mucilage instead of love. 

I lay my body out before you on the desk. 
I spread my hair amid a maze of rubber stamps. 
RUSH. SPECIAL DELIVERY. DO NOT BEND. 
I am openwill you lick me like an envelope? 
I am bleedingwill you kiss my paper cuts? 

Because she wants to touch him 
she moves away. 
Because she wants to talk to him 
she keeps silent. 
Because she wants to kiss him 
she turns away 
and kisses a man she does not want to kiss. 

He watches 
thinking she does not want him. 
He listens 
hearing her silence. 
He turns away 
thinking her distant 
and kisses a girl he does not want to kiss. 

They marry each other A 
fourway mistake. 
He goes to bed with his wife 
thinking of her. 
Sher goes to bed with her husband 
thinking of him. 
and all this in a real oldfashioned fourposter bed. 

Do they live unhappily ever after? 
Of course. 
Do they undo their mistakes? 
Never. 
Who is the victim here? 
Love is the victim. 
Who is the villian? 
Love that never dies. 

People who live by the sea 
understand eternity. 
They copy the curves of the waves 
their hearts beat with the tides 
and the saltiness of their blood 
corresponds with the sea. 

They know that the house of flesh 
is only a sandcastle 
built on the shore 
that skin breaks 
under the waves 
like sand under the soles 
of the first walker on the beach 
when the tide recedes. 

Each of us walks there once 
watching the bubbles 
rise up through the sand 
like ascending souls 
tracing the line of the foam 
drawing our index fingers 
along the horizon 
pointing home. 

All the boring tedious young men 
with dead eyes and dirty hair
all the mad young men who hate their mothers 
all the squalling baby boys

have grown up 
and now write book reviews 
or novels about the life 
of the knifefighter 
or movies in which grown men 
torture each other

all the squalling boring baby boys 

I am not part of their game. 
I have no penis. 
I have a pen two eyes 
and I bleed monthly. 

When the moon shines on the sea 
I see the babies 
riding on the moonwaves 
asking to be born. 

Does everything else in nature hate 
its mother? 
Does the chick fling 
bits of eggshell at the hen? 
Does the pear spit 
its seeds against the pear tree? 

Who made all these squalling baby boys? 

I am a reasonable hardworking woman. 
I sit at my desk and write 
from eight to three. 
When I emerge I do not ask your blessing. 
What have I done but bleed 
to get your curse? 

'Why do you 
have stripes 
in your forehead 
Mama? 
Are you 
old?' 

Not old. 
But not so 
young 
that I cannot 
see 
the world contracting 
upon itself 
and the circle 
closing 
at the end. 

As the furrows 
in my brow 
deepen 
I can see 
myself 
sinking back 
into that childhood 
street 
I walked along 
with my grandfather 
thinking he was old 
at sixtythree 
since I was four 
as you are four 
to my forty. 

Forty years 
to take 
the road out
Will another forty 
take me 
back? 

Back to the street 
I grew up on 
back to 
my mother's breast. 
back to the second 
world war 
of a second 
child 
back 
to the cradle 
endlessly 
rocking? 

I am young 
as you are 
Molly
yet with stripes 
in my brow 
I earn my youth 
as you must earn 
your age. 

These stripes 
are decorations 
for my valor
forty years 
of marching 
to a war 
I could not declare 
nor locate 
yet have somehow 
won. 

Now 
I begin 
to unwin 
unravelling 
the sleeves 
of care 
that have 
stitched up 
this brow 
unravelling 
the threads 
that have kept 
me scared 
as I pranced 
over the world 
seemingly fearless 
working 
without a net 
knowing 
if I fell 
it would 
only be 
into that same 
childhood street 
where I dreaded 
to tread 
on the lines
not knowing 
the lines 
would someday 
tread 
on me. 

Molly 
when you are forty 
read this poem 
and tell me 
have we won 
or lost 
the war? 

Kabir says 
the breath inside the breath 
is God 

and I say to Kabir 
you are the breath inside that breath 
which is not to say 
that the poet is God

but only that God 
uses the poet 
as the wind 
uses 
a sail. 

Regret is the young girl who sits in the snow 
and stares at her hands. 

They are bluer than shadows in snow. 
They are bloodless as fear. 
Her fingernail moons are white. 

She wants to crawl into the palm 
of her own hand. 
She wants extra fingers to cover 
the shame of her eyes. 

She wants to follow her lifeline where it leads 
but it plunges deeper 
than the Grand Canyon. 

She stands on the edge 
still hoping 
she can fly. 

In the redwood house sailing off 
into the ocean 
I sleep with you
our dreams mingling 
our breath coming and going 
like gusts of wind 
trifling with the breakers 
our arms touching 
and our legs and our hair 
reaching out like tendrils 
to intertwine. 

The first time 
I slept in your arms 
I knew I had come home. 
Your body was a ship 
and I rocked in it 
utterly safe in the breakers 
utterly sure of this love. 
I fit into your arms 
as a ship fits into water 
as a cactus roots in sand 
as the sun nestles into the blazing horizon. 

The house sails all night. 
Our dreams are the flags 
of little ships 
your penis the mast 
of one of the breeziest sailboats 
and my breasts floating 
half in and half out 
of the water 
are like messages in bottles. 

There is no point to this poem. 
What the sea loses 
always turns up again 
it is only a question of shores. 

She was not a slender woman 
but her skin was milk 
mixed in with strawberry jam 
and between her legs the word purple was born 
and her hair was the color of wheat and yellow butter. 

Her eyes were dark as the North Atlantic sea. 

She learned the untranslatable words of dawn. 
She studied her own fear and wrote its verses. 
She used the hole in her heart to play windmusic. 
She built her bookhouses over her empty cellar. 

She nursed on the muse at first 
then became her own mother. 

Old bag of bones 
upside down 
what are you searching for 
in poetry 
in meditation? 

The mother you never had? 

The child in you 
that you did not conceive? 

Death? 

Ease from fear of death? 

Revelation? 

Dwelling in the house of clouds 
where you imagine 
you once lived? 

'Born alone 
we depart alone.' 
Someone said that 
during meditation 
and I nearly wept. 

Oh melancholy lady 
behind your clown face 
behind your wisecracks
how heady it is 
to let the ideas rush to your brain 

But even upside down 
you are sad. 

Even upside down 
you think of your death. 
Even upside down 
you curse the emptiness. 

Meditating 
on the immobile lotus 
your mind takes flight 
like a butterfly 
and dabbles in bloodred poppies 
and purple heather. 

Defying gravity 
defying death 
what makes you think 
the body's riddle 
is better solved 
upside down? 

Blood rushes to your head 
like images that come too fast 
to write. 
After a life held in the double grips 
of gravity and time 
after a headfirst birth 
out of your mother's bowels 
and into the earth 
you practice for the next. 

You make your body light 
so that in time 
feet first 
you will be born 
into the sky. 

A man so sick that the sexual soup 
cannot save him 

the chicken soup of sex 
which cures everything 
tossed mane of noodles 
bits of pale white meat. 
the globules of yellow fat 
like love... 

But he is a man so sick 
no soup can save him. 

His throat has healed into a scar. 
Rage fills his guts. 
He wants to diet on dust. 

I offered to feed him 
spoon by spoon 
myself. 

I offered my belly as a bowl. 
I offered my hands as spoons 
my knees as tongs 
my breasts as the chafing dish 
to keep us warm 

I offered my navel 
as a brandy snifter. 

My tongue is gone he said 
I have no teeth. 
My mouth is with my mother in the grave. 
I've offered up my hunger to the air 
my nostrils to the wind 
my sex to death 
my eyes to nothingness

What do you lust for then?
I asked. 
I lust for nothing.

She leaps into the alien heart 
of the passerby the drunk 
the girl who spouts Freudian talk 
over Szechuan food. 

She is part herself 
part everyone. 
'Thank you for writing the story of my life' 
her mash notes read. 
and 'Can you tell me how to leave my husband?' 
and 'Can you tell me how to find a husband?' 
and 'Can you tell me how to write 
or how to feel 
or how to save my life?' 

She knows nothing 
but how to leap. 
She has no answers for herself 
or anyone. 

One foot after another 
she flies through the air

She leaps over cracks 
and breaks 
her father's back. 

I love to go to sleep 
When bed takes me like a lover 
wrapping my limbs in 
cool linen soothing 
the fretfulness 
of day glaring like 
the Cyclops' eye 
in a forehead 
of furrows. 

But I wake 
always reluctantly brushing 
the dreamcrumbs 
from my lids 
walking sideways underwater 
like a crab 
spilling coffee 
knocking the mug 
to the floor 
where it shatters 
in a muddy river 
to my continuo of 
'Shit shit shit' 

What if death 
is only a forgetting 
to wake in the morning 
a dream that goes on 
into other corridors 
other chambers 
draped with other silks 
libraries of unwritten books 
whose caleidoscopic pages 
can be read 
only by the pinneal eye 
music that can only be heard 
by the seventh sense 
or the eighth or ninth 
until we possess 
an infinity of senses
none of them 
dependent on flesh? 

What if our love of sleep 
is only a foretaste 
of the bliss that awaits us 
when we do not have to wake again? 

What frightens us so 
about falling? 
To dropp the body and fly 
should be as natural 
as drifting into a dream. 
But we are insomniacs 
tossing on soaked sheets 
hanging on 
to our intricate pain 
while God with her sweet 
Mona Lisa smile 
sings lullabyes 
the ears of the living 
cannot hear. 

Smoke it is all smoke 
in the throat of eternity
For centuries the air was full of witches 
Whistling up chimneys 
on their spiky brooms 
cackling or singing more sweetly than Circe 
as they flew over rooftops 
blessing and cursing their 
kind. 

We banished and burned them 
making them smoke in the throat of god 
we declared ourselves 
enlightened. 
The dark age of horrors is past 
said my mother to me in 1952 
seven years after our people went up in smoke 
leaving a few teeth a pile of bones. 

The smoke curls and beckons. 
It is blue and lavender 
and green as the undersea world. 
It will take us too. 

O let us not go sheepishly 
clinging to our nakedness. 
But let us go like witches sucked heavenward 
by the Goddess' powerful breath 
and whistling whistling whistling 
on our beautiful brooms. 

Cement up to the neck 
and my head packed 
with unsaid words. 
A gullet full of pebbles 
a mouth 
of cast concrete
I am stuck 
in a lovelessness so thick 
it seems my natural element. 
My mouth closes 
on stones. 

Hand frozen to my chin 
my back a question mark 
my heart soldered 
to its arteries 
my feet planted 
in grass that cannot grow 
The Thinker ponders 
ten more years of this 
a woman 
living the life 
of a statue. 

Break free 
Melt the metal 
in love's cauldron 
open doors eyes heart 
those frozen ventricles 
those stuck tongues 
those stuttering dependencies. 

When the statue walks 
will the world dissolve? 
When she shakes her shoulders 
will the sky shrug 
and skitter off in space? 

Or will the clouds cluster 
to cover her 
and the blue wind gather 
at her shoulders 
and the men streak by 
like jet trails in the air 
utterly ephemeral? 

Because you did I too arrange flowers 
Watching the pistils just like insolent tongues 
And the hard red flesh of the petals 
Widening beneath my eyes. They move like the hands 
Of clocks seeming not to move except 
When I turn my gaze then savagely 
In the white room they billow and spread 
Until their redness engulfs me utterly. 

Mother you are far away and claim 
In mournful letters that I do not need you 
Yet here in this sunny room your tulips 
Devour me sucking hungrily 
My watery nourishment filling my house 
Like a presence like an enemy. 

Geared to your intervals as the small hand 
Of a clock repeats the larger I 
Your toofaithful daughter still drag behind you 
Turning in the same slow circles. 

Across the years and distances my hands 
Among these fierce red blossoms repeat 
Your gestures. I hope my daughter never writes 
'Because you did I too arrange flowers.' 

After the teachin 
we smeared the walls with 
our solidarity 
looked left and saw 
Marx among the angels 
singing the blues. 

The students march 
I spectator 
follow. 
Here as everywhere 
the Polizei 
are clean are clean. 

In Frankfurt 
the whores lean out 
their windows screaming 
'Get a job  you dirty 
hippies' Or words 
auf Deutsch to that effect. 

I'm also waiting 
for the Revolution 
friends. 
Surely my poems 
will get better. 
Surely I'll no longer 
fear my dreams. 
Surely I will not murder 
my capitalist father 
each night 
just to inherit 
his love. 

I sit at home 
at my desk alone 
as I used to do 
on many sunday afternoons 
when you came back to me 
your arms ached for me 
and your arms would close me in 
though they smelled of other women. 

I think of you 
on Sunday afternoons. 

Your sweet head would bow 
like a child somehow 
down to me and 
your hair and your eyes were wild. 

We would embrace on the floor
You see my back¬¥s still sore. 
You knew how easily I bruised 
It¬¥s a soreness I would never lose. 

I think of you 
on Sunday afternoons. 

What happens when the juice of the sun 
drenches you 
with its lemony tang its tart sweetness 
and your whole body stings with singing 
so that your toes sing to your mouth 
and your navel whistles to your breasts 
and your breasts wave to everyone 
as you walk down the summer street? 

What will you do 
when nothing will do 
but to throw your arms around trees 
and men 
and greet every woman as sister 
and to run naked in the spray of the fire hydrants 
with children of assorted colors? 

Will you cover your drenched skin 
with woolen clothes? 
Will you wear a diaper of herringbone tweed? 
Will you piece together a shroud of figleaves 
and lecture at the University 
on the Lives of the Major Poets 
the History of Despair in Art? 

In the chest is caged bat 
who seeks escape 
through the mouth. 

He flaps his wings 
and the molars shiver. 

He flaps his wings 
and the thyroid bulges 
like a snake 
that has swallowed 
a mouse. 

He flaps his wings 
uttering shrill cries 
heard only by the ears 
of the teeth. 

He wants to soar 
into the great world. 
He is blind 
as a bat. 

You must convince him 
that the chest 
is a cradle 
and a room 
with a view. 

Past the tonsils 
lies terror. 

Past the teeth 
lies death. 
Past the lips 
lie lies 
lies lies. 

If you ask him he will talk for hourshow 
at fourteen he hammered signs fingers 
raw with cold and later painted bowers 
in ladies' boudoirs how he played checkers 
for two weeks in jail and lived on dark bread 
how he fled the border to a country 
which disappeared wars ago unfriended 
crossed a continent while this century 
began. He seldom speaks of painting now. 
Young men have time and theories old men work. 
He has painted countless portraits. Sallow 
nameless faces made glistening in oil smirk 
above anonymous mantelpieces. 
The turpentine has a familiar smell 
but his hand trembles with odd new palsies. 
Perched on the maulstick it nears the easel. 

He has come to like his resignation. 
In his sketch books inkdark cossacks hear 
the snorts of horses in the crunch of snow. 
His pen alone recalls that years ago 
one horseman set his teeth and aimed his spear 
which poised seemed pointed straight to pierce the sun. 

The great bed of the world 
arching over graves 
over Babi Yar 
with its multitude of bones 
with battalions of screams 
frozen in a concrete glacier 
with pillows of earth 
and comforters of green grass 
covering all that dead flesh. 

Dead flesh shall live again
a dream in god's endless night
rise green out of the earth 
as grass as trees as tomato stalks 
bearing a bright red fruit 
and the feuds of manand womankind 
shall be fed again from the same seeds 
the tomato the mythic pomegranate the biblical apple 
all rising from the grass that springs 
out of the screams of stopped mouths. 

Sometimes I dream 
that my bed is built over a ravine 
the ravine of Babi Yar any ravine 
where thousands died 
and I moan in pleasure to propitiate the earth 
to make fruit ripen 
and trees wave green leaves like banners 
all because love can touch me still. 

It is never enough to create. 
The beast must feed its meat teeth too. 
Out of the screaming mouth of earth 
we feed the grass that covers 
all our beds. 

I wish I did not know all that I know. 
Galaxies spin grass grows and people kill. 
We are the only race to murder for our dreams
and not for hunger 
hungering for dreams 

Little egg 
little nub 
full complement of 
fingers toes 
little rose blooming 
in a red universe 
which once wanted you less 
than emptiness 
but now holds you 
fast 
containing your rapid heart 
beat under its 
slower one 
as the earth 
contains the sea... 

O avocado pit 
almost ready to sprout 
tiny fruit tree 
within sight 
of the sea 
little swimming fish 
little land lover 
hold on 
hold on 

Here under my heart 
you'll keep 
till it's time 
for us to meet 
and we come apart 
that we may come 
together 
and you are born 
remembering 
the wavesound 
of my blood 
the thunder of my heart 
and like your mother 
always dreaming 
of the sea. 

I put our books face to face 
so they could talk. 
They whispered about us. 

I put yours on top of mine. 
They would not mate. 

Like poor dumb pandas in the London Zoo 
they would not come together. 

I put them back to back. 
They would not sleep. 

I put them right side up to upside down. 
They would not lick each other's wounds. 

The night we met 
you fed me fish eggs and dark beer. 
We spoke of animals and Shakespeare. 
You talked about acidic inks and papers. 
You told me how our books digest themselves. 

You laid the pages of your body over mine. 
You printed my face with kisses. 
The letters fell into a heap under our bed. 
The sheets were dust. 
The fish eggs swam our mouths. 

Bobbing in the waters of the womb 
little godhead ten toes ten fingers 
and infinite hope 
sails upside down through the world. 

My bones I know are only a cage 
for death. 
Meditating I can see my skull 
a death's head 
lit from within 
by candles 
which are possibly the suns 
of other galaxies. 

I know that death 
is a movement toward light 
a happy dream 
from which you are loath to awaken 
a lover left 
in a country 
to which you have no visa 
and I know that the horses of the spirit 
are galloping galloping galloping 
out of time 
and into the moment called NOW. 

Why then do I care 
for this upsidedown Buddha 
bobbling through the world 
his toes his fingers 
alive with blood 
that will only sing and die. 

There is a light in my skull 
and a light in his. 
We meditate on our bones only 
to let them blow away 
with fewer regrets. 

Flesh is merely a lesson. 
We learn it 
and pass on. 

You take me to the restaurant where one 
plays God over a fish tank. The fat trout 
pace their green cage waiting to be taken 
out of an element. Who knows what they know? 
There are thirteen in a tank meant 
for goldfish. I don¬πt care which one I eat. 

But the waiter expects a performance 
con brio. This is a ritual 
solemn as winetasting or the Last Judgement. 
Eating is never so simple as hunger. 
Between the appetite and its satisfaction 
falls the net groping blindly in dark water. 

The fish startle and thrash. You make your catch 
flourishing a bit for the waiter 
so as not to be thought a peasant. You force 
air into the trout's gills as if he were Adam 
and send him squirming toward the kitchen 
to be born. Then it's my turn. I surprise 

myself with my dexterity almost 
enjoying the game. A liter of wine 
later the fish return foppishly dressed 
in mushrooms and pimentos their eyes 
dreamily hazed. Darling I am drunk. I watch you pluck 
the trout's ribs out of your perfect teeth. 

What is the central passion 
of a life? 
To please mummy and daddy? 
To find a home for their furniture? 
To found a family of one's own 
possibly a dynasty? 
To fill the world with more books 
that have no readers 
or books that have too many 
and kill 
too many trees? 

What is the passion 
that drives us 
as the wind drives 
a winged seed? 
To reproduce ourselves 
then die? 
To meet God once 
if only in a dream? 
To reach enlightenment 
through pain 
or pleasure? 

Or perhaps just 
to question 
as I am doing now 
and to teach by questioning

Yes this is both passion 
and power 
enough. 

Putting the skis down 
in the white snow 
the wind singing 
the blizzard of time 
going past your eyes 

it is a little 
like being snowed in 
in the Connecticut house 
on a day when the world 
goes away 

and only the white dog 
follows you out 
to make fresh tracks 
in the long blue shadow 
of the mountain. 

We are all halfway there 
preferring not 
to think about it. 

You went down the mountain 
first 
in a blaze of light 
reminding us 
to seize our lives 
to live with the wind 
whistling in our ears 
and the light bedazzling 
the tips of our skis 

and the people we love 
waiting in the lodge below 
scribbling lines 
on paper the color 
of snow 
knowing there is no 
holding on 
but only the wind singing 
and these lines of light 
shining 
in the fresh snow. 

The cover of the book 
is astral violet 
and within it 
are poems 
most of them 
earthbound 
but for one 
to the poet's 
daughter 
which soars 
into 
the empyrean 
on umbilical wings. 

Oh we poets 
are so afraid 
of making babiesand 
yet 
of all 
the fleshly chains 
that bind us 
our children 
are the chains 
that bind 
most closely 
to heaven. 

How can that be? 

Poetry 
is an astral 
affliction. 

Poets are always 
saving themselves 
for their poems. 
Yet in that saving 
there is no grace 
while in the child 
there is distraction 
chaos disorder 
and through that fleshly chaos 
peace. 

It used to be hard 
for women 
snowed in their white lives 
white lies 
to write books 
with that fine frenzy 
which commends genius 
to posterity 
yet estranges it 
from its closest 
friends. 

Women were friends to all 
and being too friendly 
they could not command 
the unfriendly prerogatives 
of genius 
though some were 
geniuses still 
destroying 
only themselves 
with the torment 
of the unfriendly ghost 
trapped in a friendly 
form. 

Oh the women who died 
dissembling friendship 
for the world 
Oh the women who turned 
the dagger inward 
when it wished 
to go out 
who impaled themselves 
on Womanhood itself 

No vampire 
could be 
as greedy for blood 
no father or husband 
as bullying. 
A woman punishing herself 
with her own pain 
is a fierce opponent indeed. 

It is self against self 
dagger to dagger 
blood of her blood 
blood of her daughter 
blood of her mother 
her menses her moon 
all pooled together 
one crimson sea. 

It is the awful auto da f√© 
the sublime seppuku 
Sante Sebastiana 
as archer 
and victim too. 

The arrow flies from her bow. 
She runs fleet as Diana 
and stops it 
with her breast. 

Enough 
cried the WomenWhoCared. 
Henceforth we will turn 
our anger where it belongs. 
We will banish the whitest lies. 
We will speak the black truth as it is. 
Our father we spit back their sperm. 
Our husbands we spit back their names. 
Our brothers we suck back our love. 

The selfrighteous inherit the earth 
and anger speaks louder that love. 
Love is a softness 
the weak cannot afford 
and sex a Darwinian bribe. 

But who wants the earth as a gift 
when it is empty as space 
when women grow hard 
as bronze madonnas 
and Diana loves only her stag? 

When Persephone stays in hell 
the entire year 
then how can spring 
begin? 

This is the dirty laundry poem
because we have traveled from town to town 
accumulating soiled linen and sweaty shirts 
and bluejeans caked and clotted with our juice 
and teeshirts crumpled by our gloriously messy passion 
and underwear made stiff by all our joy. 

I have come home to wash my clothes. 
They patter on the bathroom floor like rain. 
The water drips away the days till you. 
The dirty water speaks to me of love. 

Steamy in the bubbles of our love 
I have plunged my hands into hot water 
as I might plunge them 
in your heart. 

After years of spots and splatters 
I am finally coming clean. 
I will fly to you with a suitcase of fresh laundry 
strip my clothes off heap them on the floor 
and let you scrub my body with your love. 

Because he dreams of seeding the world with words 
his eyes bite 
She looks He looks away 
He is snowblind 
from staring at her breasts 
They make love 
This is marked by asterisks 
those gaps 
disguised as stars 

He thinks the future is a mouth 
She invites him 
into her apple 

Here at the end of the world 
the flowers bleed 
as if they were hearts 
the hearts ooze a darkness 
like india ink 
and poets dip their pens in 
and they write. 

Here at the end of the world 
they write 
not knowing what it means. 
Here where the sky nurses on black milk 
where the smokestack feed the sky 
where the trees tremble in terror 
and people come to resemble them

Here at the end of the world 
the poets are bleeding. 
Writing and bleeding 
are thought to be the same 
singing and bleeding 
are thought to be the same. 

Write us a letter 
Send us a parcel of food 
Comfort us with proverbs or candied fruit 
with talk of one God. 
Distract us with theories of art 
no one can prove. 

Here at the end of the world 
our heads are empty 
and the wind walks through them 
like ghosts 
through a haunted house. 

I had pegged you as 
prot√©g√© adoptee 
someone I could save. 

The last thing 
I needed 
was 
another lover. 

You call yourself 
'an accident 
looking 
for a place 
to happen.' 
I call you 
my sweet my love 
not only 
because you carry knives 
for me 
and want to beat up 
all my 
exhusbandsbut 
because 
you can laugh 
at yourself 
for wanting to. 

We dream 
of the baby 
we will never have. 
The little Jewish WASP 
with golden blue eyes 
poems on the tip of his tongue. 
your height my hair 
and jokes that hit 
their targets 
on a slant. 

He will never be 
in the Social Register. 
But will he know 
which fork to take
as you did 
when you drove 
off my road 
slyly taking the wrong fork 
in order to stay 
the night? 

O you are sly 
my sweet wheat 
looking for 
a harvest. 

Shall I reap you? 
Shall I do to you 
what the hurricane 
does with the waving 
grain? 
Shall I thresh and bind you 
run barefoot 
through your body 
trying to stamp out 
death? 

Or shall I merely 
let you 
lift me up 
like the wind spinning 
an errant seed 

and let it 
take me 
where it will 
right fork 
wrong fork 
no fork 
at all 
since we will take 
the same path 
through 
the air 
after all? 

Out in the world the child 
cries for the mother 
as the wound cries for salt 
as the lover cries 
for her unrequited lover 
as the ice cries out 
for melting in the spring. 

My heart is a spring 
that pumps red blood. 
I would give my child 
my girl child my daughter 
the vision of a mother 
who does not flinch 
when the heavy heel of man 
comes down 
who loves the penis 
when it pumps rich red blood 
but values the wholeness 
of her heart 
above that battering organ 
that dumb implement 
which can so easily turn 
from kind to cruel. 

My heart is out in the world 
like an orphan howling 
on a street corner. 
I want a warm safe place 
to hide my books my child 
my heart 
that is scarred 
seamed like a belly 
which has given birth 
to an imperious baby Caesar 

but still 
despite its bursting fullness 

Broken ivories 
playing 
the blue piano 
of the sea. 

We have come 
from the bitter city 
to heal ourselves. 
We have come 
looking for a patch of beach 
not yet built into a fortress 
of realestate greed 
a coral reef 
not yet picked clean 
of buried treasure 
not yet bare of birds. 

The first night in the Keys 
I dreamed I was a bird 
soaring over a hilly city 
soaring and dipping 
like a gull or egret. 
and I thought 
'Ah this is a flying dream 
Enjoy it.' 

But I really think 
that my soul 
has been transported 
for a night 
into the body of 
a bird 
and I was flying. 

I woke up 
exhausted 
arms weary 
eyes red. 
The beach was dazzling 
with its white sand 
the sun blinding 
and I seemed to know the palm trees 
from above 
as well as below. 

They root in the sand 
with elephant feet 
yet they also root 
their delicate fronds 
in air. 
and these are a comfort 
as you fly 
half bird half human 
through a dream of sky. 

Everything was new 
to a spirit 
so divided 
between two kingdoms. 
The water was alive 
with fish 
the air with birds 
and palm fronds 
clouds thunderous presences 
of rain 
gathering and parting 
and fiery sun playing through. 

I knew 
that I stood 
on a patch of earth 
connected to the sky 
that my heart beat 
with the sea 
that my arms moved 
with the clouds 
that my flesh 
was finally irrelevant 
though it surrounded me 
as the case of a piano 
surrounds its strings 
while the fingers play 
on the ivory keys 
and the human music 
rises to the sky. 

This is the long tunnel of wanting you. 
Its walls are lined with remembered kisses 
wet and red as the inside of your mouth 
full and juicy as your probing tongue 
warm as your belly against mine 
deep as your navel leading home 
soft as your sleeping cock beginning to stir 
tight as your legs wrapped around mine 
straight as your toes pointing toward the bed 
as you roll over and thrust your hardness 
into the long tunnel of my wanting 
seeding it with dreams and unbearable hope 
making memories of the future 
straightening out my crooked past 
teaching me to live in the present present tense 
with the past perfect and the uncertain future 
suddenly certain for certain 
in the long tunnel of my old wanting 
which before always had an ending 
but now begins and begins again 
with you with you with you. 

The man giving birth in the dark 
has died 
and come back 
to life again 

is stretching out his arms 
in the dark 
as if to embrace 
favorite ghosts. 

His heart stops 
and starts. 
Once more 
he has been pardoned 

for nothing. 
It is my father 
making the darkness 
into daughters. 

The man under the bed 
The man who has been there for years waiting 
The man who waits for my floating bare foot 
The man who is silent as dustballs riding the darkness 
The man whose breath is the breathing of small white butterflies 
The man whose breathing I hear when I pick up the phone 
The man in the mirror whose breath blackens silver 
The boneman in closets who rattles the mothballs 
The man at the end of the end of the line 

I met him tonight I always meet him 
He stands in the amber air of a bar 
When the shrimp curl like beckoning fingers 
and ride through the air on their toothpick skewers 
When the ice cracks and I am about to fall through 
he arranges his face around its hollows 
he opens his pupilless eyes at me 
For years he has waited to drag me down 
and now he tells me 
he has only waited to take me home 
We waltz through the street like death and the maiden 
We float through the wall of the wall of my room 

If he's my dream he will fold back into my body 
His breath writes letters of mist on the glass of my cheeks 
I wrap myself around him like the darkness 
I breathe into his mouth 
and make him real 

You are the first muse who came to stay. 
The others began and ended with a wish 
or a glance or a kiss between stanzas 
the others strode away in the pointed boots of their fear 

or were kicked out by the stiletto heels of mine 
or merely padded away in bare feet 
when the ground was too hard or cold 
or as hot as white sand baked under the noonday sun. 

But you flew in on the wings of your smile 
powered by the engine of your cock 
driven by your lonely pumping heart 
rooted by your arteries to mine. 

We became a tree with a double apical point 
reaching equally toward what some call heaven 
singing in the wind with our branches 
sharing the sap and syrup 
which makes the trunk grow thick. 

We are seeding the ground with poems and children. 
We are the stuff of books and newgrown forests. 
We are renewing the earth with our roots 
the air with our pure oxygen songs 
the nearby seas with leaves we lose 
only to grow the greener ones again. 

I used to leap from tree to tree 
speaking glibly of Druids 
thinking myself a latterday dryad 
or a wood nymph from the stony city 
or some other chimerical creature 
conjured in my cheating poet's heart. 

But now I stay knowing the muse is mine 
knowing no books will banish him 
and no offkey songs will drive him away. 

I being and begin I whistle in and out of tune. 
If the ending is near I do not think of it. 
If the drought comes we will make our own rain. 
If the muse is grounded I will make him fly 
and if he falls I will catch him in my arms 
until he flies with me again. 

On the other side of the page 
where the last days go 
where the lost poems go 
where the forgotten dreams 
breaking up like morning fog 

go 
go 
go 

I am preparing myself for death. 

I am teaching myself emptiness 
the gambler's hunger for love 
the nun's hunger for God 
the child's hunger for chocolate 
in the brown hours 
of the dark. 

I am teaching myself love 
the lean love of marble 
kissed away by rain 
the cold kisses of snow crystals 
on granite grave markers 

the soul kisses of snow 
as it melts in the spring. 

On the other side of the page 
I lie making a snow angel 
with the arcs 
of my arms. 

I lie like a fallen skier 
who never wants to get up. 

I lie with my poles my pens 
flung around me in the snow 
too far to reach. 

The snow seeps 
into the hollows of my bones 
and the calcium white of the page 
silts me in like a fossil. 

I am fixed in my longing for speech 
I am buried in the snowbank of my poems 
I am here where you find me 

dead 

He says he is a perfect poet. 
He lives alone with his perfect mate. 
and sometimes they do not even speak 
So perfectly do they 'communicate.' 

He lives alone his greatest pleasures are 
His pipes his books his wife's behind
Which he will often pinch to hear her laugh 
He's got a perfect love for womankind. 

He seldom writes distrusting language as 
A clumsy tool unequal to his thoughts 
He uses it as rarely as he can 
No doubt to punish it for all its faults. 

But when he writes he keeps the upper hand 
On principle since words are enemies. 
He melts them down then counterfeits his own
A kind of literary alchemy. 

He's fortunate to have a perfect muse. 
A livein muse who cooks inspiringly 
And sometimes after an ambrosial meal 
He'll grab his pen composing feverishly 

A perfect poem describing in detail 
The salad wine the roast in buttery baste. 
And reading it his musing wife agrees 
That every line smacks of his perfect taste. 

Sometimes the poem 
does not want to come 
it hides from the poet 
like a playful cat 
who has run 
under the house 
and lurks among slugs 
roots spiders' eyes 
ledge so long out of the sun 
that it is dank 
with the breath of the Troll King. 

Sometimes the poem 
darts away 
like a coy lover 
who is afraid of being possessed 
of feeling too much 
of losing his essential 
lonelinesswhich he calls 
freedom. 

Sometimes the poem 
cannot requite 
the poet's passion. 

The poem is a dance 
between poet and poem 
but sometimes the poem 
just will not dance 
and lurks on the sidelines 
tapping its feet
iambs trochees
out of step with the music 
of your mariachi band. 

If the poem will not come 
I say sneak up on it. 
Pretend you do not care. 
Sit in your chair 
reading Shakespeare Neruda 
immortal Emily 
and let yourself flow 
into their music. 

Go to the kitchen 
and start peeling onions 
for homemade sugo. 

Before you know it 
the poem will be crying 
as your ripe tomatoes 
bubble away 
with inspiration. 

When the whole house is filled 
with the tender tomato aroma 
start kneading the pasta. 

As you rock 
over the damp sensuous dough 
making it bend to your will 
as you make love to this manna 
of flour and water 
the poem will get hungry 
and come 
just like a cat 
coming home 
when you least 
expect her. 

What makes a poet? 

Many have tried to guess. 
Is it a voice 
like a conduit 
a plainspokenness to grief 
the hairs of the head 
dancing on end 
the blood swarming 
with the voices 
of all those who have died 
will die 
and will also be born? 

Is it a catch 
in the throat 
that awakens the eyes 
is it in the eyes themselves 
or is it something 
in the heart? 

I think it is pain
an openness to pain 
so that the least leaf 
cuts the hand 
and the smallest tear 
cuts the cheek 
like jagged crystal 

so that the world 
is a sick infant 
and the poet its mother 
praying crooning promising 
to be good 
if only the cure 
takes. 

There is of course 
no cure. 

Poetry does not cure 
the poet 
and the poet 
does not cure the world. 

Usually he catches 
the world's diseases 
and dies 
even before his time. 

But against all odds 
and all indifference 
another one is born. 
The world must have 
someone to feel its pain 
and speak of it. 

The poet is that mouth. 

The poet fears failure 
and so she says 
Hold on penwhat 
if the critics 
hate me? 
and with that question 
she blots out more lines 
than any critic could. 

The critic is only doing his job 
keeping the poet lonely. 
He barks 
like a dog at the door 
when the master comes home. 

It's in his doggy nature. 
If he did not know the poet 
for the boss 
he wouldn't bark so loud. 

and the poet? 
It's in her nature 
to fear failure 
but not to let that fear 
blot out 
her lines. 

The raspberries 
in my driveway 
have always 
been here 
for the whole eleven years 
I have owned 
but have not owned 
this house 
yet 
I have never 
tasted them 
before. 

Always on a plane. 
Always in the arms 
of man not God 
always too busy 
too fretful 
too worried 
to see 
that all along 
my driveway 
are red red raspberries 
for me to taste. 

Shiny and red 
without hairs
unlike the berries 
from the market. 
Little jewels
I share them 
with the birds 

On one perches 
a tiny green insect. 

I blow her off. 
She flies 
I burst the raspberry 
upon my tongue. 

In my solitude 
I commune 
with raspberries 
with grasses 
with the world. 

The world was always 
there before 
but where 
was I? 

Ah raspberry
if you are so beautiful 
upon my ready tongue 
imagine 
what wonders 
lie in store for me 

You gave me a rose 
last time we met. 

I told myself 
if it bloomed 
our love would bloom 
and if it died

O I did not 
consider 
the possibility. 

It died. 

Though I cut 
the stem 
on a slant 
as my mother 
taught me 
though I dropped 
an aspirin 
in the water 

it hung its head 
like a spent cock 
and died. 

It stands 
on my desk now
straight green stalk 
bloodred clot 
of bud 
drooping 
like a hanged man's 
head. 

Does this mean 
we are doomed? 
Does this mean 
all lovers 
are doomed? 

O my love
I have not read roses 
as amulets 
in seven years

Which doom 
is worse? 
To love 
and lose? 

Or to lose 
love 
altogether 
and not care 
whether roses 

live or die? 

We used to meet 
on this corner 
in the same wind. 
It fought us up the hill 
to your house 
blew us in the door. 
The elevator rose 
on guests of stale air 
fed on ancient dinners. 
Your room smelled 
of roach spray and roses. 

In those days 
we went to bed with Marvell. 
The wind ruffled sheets and pages 
spoke to us through walls. 
For hours I used to lie 
with my ear to your bare chest 
listening for the sea. 

Now the wind is tearing 
the building down. 
The sheets are rising. 

They billow through the air like sails. 

White with your semen 
holding invisible prints 
of the people we were 
the people we might have been 
they said across the country 
disguised as clouds. 

Momentarily they snag 
on the Rocky Mountains 
then rise 
shredded into streamers. 

Now they are bannering westward 
over California 
where your existence 
is rumored. 

At the furthermost reach of the sea 
where Atlantis sinks under the wake of the waves 
I have come to heal my life. 

I knit together like a broken arm. 
The salt fills the crevices of bone. 
The sea takes all the fragments of my lives 
and grinds them home. 

I wake up in a waterbed with you. 
The sea is singing and my skin 
sings against your skin. 
The waves are all around us and within. 
We sleep stuck to each other's salt. 

I am healing in your arms. 
I am leaning to write without the loss of love. 
I am growing deeper lungs here by the sea. 
The waves are knives they glitter and cut clean. 

This is the sea's surgery. 
This is the cutting and the healing both. 
This is where bright sunlight warms the bone 
and fog erases us then makes us whole. 

For a long time unhappy 
with my man 
I blamed men 
blamed marriage blamed 
the whole bleeding world 
Because I could not lie in bed with him 
without lying to him 
or else to myself 
and lying to myself 
became increasingly hard 
as my poems 
struck rock. 

My life and my poems lived apart 
I had to marry them 
and marrying them 
meant divorcing him 
divorcing the lie. 

Now I lie in bed 
with my poems on the sheets 
and a man I love 
sleeping or reading 
at my side. 

Because I love him 
I do not think of him 
as 'Men' 
but as my friend. 
Hate generalizes 
love is particular. 

He is not Men man male
all those maddening m's 
muttering like machinegun spittle 
but only a person like me 
dreaming vulnerable scared 
his dreams 
opening into rooms 
where the chairs 
are wishes you can sit on 
and the rugs are wonderful 
with oriental birds. 

The first month we lived together 
I was mad with joy 
thinking that a person with a penis 
could dream tell jokes even cry. 
Now I found it usual 
and when other women sputter 
of their rage 
I look at them blankly 
half comprehending 
those poor medieval creatures 
from a dark dark age. 

I wonder about myself. 
Was I always so fickle? 
Must politics always be personal? 
If I struck oil 
would I crusade 
for depletion allowances? 

Erica Erica 
you are hard on yourself. 
Lie back and enjoy the ceasefire. 

Trouble will come again. 
Sex will grow horns and warts. 
The white sheets of this bed 
will be splattered with blood. 
Just wait. 

But I do not believe it. 
There will be trouble enough 
but a different sort. 

She left him in death's egg 
the bone sack and the gunny sack 
the bag of down and feathersall black
Somehow he couldn't get back. 

It was night 
a night of sharkfaced jets 
winking brighter than blue stars 
a night of poisoned cities 
mushrooming beneath the eyes of jets 
a night of missile silos 
sulking in the desert 
a night of babies howling in the alleys 
a night of cats. 

She left a death so huge 
his life got lost in it. 
She left a bloodstained egg 
he had to hatch. 

Your slit so like mine 
the woman of it 
the warm womanwide of thigh 
and the comfort of it
knowing your nipples like mine 
and the likeness of it 
watching the mirror make love 
and the lovematch 
the mirror of you 
in me. 

I have creamed my hands 
in the cave 
I have known my mother. 
Years to get past 
the barrier reefs of words. 
We were natural together 
as two little girls in the bath. 
We hoped to be women someday 
we hoped to grow up. 

There is a white wood house near Hampstead Heath 
in whose garden the nightingale still sings. 
Though Keats is dead the bird who sang of death 
returns with melodies on easeful wings. 

A lock of hair the poet's love received 
remains in the room where first it was shorn 
An heirloom its history halfbelieved 
its strands now faded and its ribbon worn. 

On polished floors through squares of summer sun 
I felt his footsteps move as if the elf 

deceiving elf he called her  had not done 
with making mischief to amuse herself. 
I saw him clip that tousled lock of hair 
and though he did not offer it to me 
I felt that I was privileged standing there 
and took his gesture for my legacy. 

There is only one story 
he loved her 
then stopped loving her 
while she did not 
stop loving him. 

There is only one story 
she loved him 
then stopped loving him 
while he did not 
stop loving her. 

The truth is simple 
you do not die 
from love. 

You only wish 
you did. 

Looking for a place 
where we might turn off 
the inner dialogue 
the monologue 
of futures and regrets 
of pasts not past enough 
and futures that may never come 
to pass 
we found this boat 
bobbing in the blue 
this refuge amid reefs 
this white hull 
within this azure sibilance of sea 
this central rocking 
so like the rocking 
before birth. 

Venus was born of the waters 
borne over them 
to teach us about love
our only sail 
on the seas of our lives 
as death is 
our only anchor. 

If we return again and again 
to the sea 
both in our dreams 
and for our love affairs 
it is because 
this element alone 
understands our pasts 
and futures 
as she makes them 
one. 

For centuries 
we have lain like this 
our warmths intermingled 
our hearts beating 
the same twostep 
and our breaths 
and our limbs 
intertwined. 

Life after life 
I return to flesh 
to join my flesh 
to your flesh. 
Sometimes I am the woman 
and you the man 
sometimes 
the other way around. 

It hardly matters. 
Flesh after flesh 
our spirits return 
to mingle. 
Death is no barrier 
and life's noisy matinee 
where the suburban ladies 
cough and sputter 
and their programs crackle like kindling 
merely goes on and on. 

They sit on their deaths 
as if they were sitting 
on fur coats 
while we touch 
for the first time 
remembering 
the next. 

Sick of the self 
the selfseducing self
with its games its fears 
its misty memories and its prix fixe menu 
of seductions so familiar 
even to the seducer 
that he grows sick 
of looking at himself 
in the mirrored ceiling 
before he takes the plunge into this new 
distraction from the self 
which in fact leads back 
to self. 

Selfthe prison. 
Lovethe answer and the door. 
And yet the self should also be a door 
swinging letting loves both in and out 
for change 
is the world's only fixity and fixity 
her foremost lie. 

How to trust love 
which has so often 
betrayed the betrayer 
seduced the seducer 
and then turned out 
to be not even love? 
We are jaded 
divorced from our selves 
without ever having found 
ourselvesand yet we 
long for wholeness 
if not fixity 
for harmony 
if not music of the spheres. 

If life is a flood 
and there is no ark 
then where do the animals float 
two by two? 

I refuse to believe 
that the flesh falls 
from their bones 
without ever understanding 
ever coming 
and I refuse to believe 
that we must leave 
this life entirely alone. 

Much harumphing 
across the ocean 
my brother poet coughs 
clears his throat 
he smokes too much 
and gazes into the murky 
depths of his wordprocessor 
as if it were a crystal ball. 
I do not know 
all that hides 
in his heart of darkness 
but I know I love 
the thoughts 
that cloud the surface 
of his crystal ball. 

He longs to leap 
headlong into his future 
and cannot. 
This chapter's finished 
his self peels back 
a skin. 
Snakes hiss 
shedding their scales. 
The goddess smiles. 
She sends her missives 
only to the brave. 

Boswell  you old rake  I have tried to imitate 
your style but it is no use my dialogues are 
all between my selves and though I sit up late 
make endless notes and jottings that I hope will jar 
my memory  it is in vain  for in the end 
I have no Dr. Johnson but myself. 

The difference is I think between our lives. You spend 
the morning at the coffee house nourish yourself 
with talk and kippers before proceeding on to dine. 
A ramble across London perks the appetite. 
Every step is an adventure the written line 
distills itself from life. How can you help but write? 

I consort with books while you see men haunt the shelves 
where your London lies buried. Your book once opened 
I become the ghost a pale phantom who delves 
into your life to borrow moments penned 
two hundred years ago. I roam your world ignored while 
my own life waiting outside questions my motives. 

A man should never live more than he can record 
you say but what if he records more than he lives? 
My journal swarms with me and even I am bored. 
I am all my personae  children lovers wives 
philosophers and countrywenches. Though I give them 
different robes and wigs to wear all converse alike 
all reason falsely with the same stratagem 
each suspects the logic of the other dislikes 
him yet cannot prove him wrong. Petty cavils 
grow to monstrous issues belabored arguments 
resolve themselves only in sleep darkness prevails. 
Only the living find solace in common sense. 

Safe preserved from the rape of the world I grow 
dishonest and pen my crooked words for one can lie 
with ease about those things the world will never know. 
Conversation  that clearinghouse for thoughts  denied 
the mind gets gouty and the conscience needs a cane. 

Notions unuttered seem to echo through the brain and 
our monologues are doomed to the same end. 
We all think better  interrupted by a friend. 

Knowing our lives a drowse 
towards death 
attended by dogs 
and children 
how can it not matter 
that I remember 
day after day 
that one day 
we shall lose 
each other 
lose the lights 
in each other's eyes 
to death 
and drift off 
to other universes. 

Love shall not save us 
from being alone at the end 
and the daughter we made 
in that fine high exuberance 
of having found each other 
shall not save us either. 

We shall go off 
into the ether alone 
trying to remember 
as the threads unravel 
and the brain cells turn 
to fluffy cumulus clouds 

that on clear October days 
like this one 
when the hills were 
red with maple 
gold with oak 
we bumped along in the Jeep 
reminding each other 
'Wake up Wake up 
This will not last forever' 

My life has been 
the instrument 
for a mouth 
I have never seen 
breathing wind 
which comes 
from I know not 
where 
arranging and changing 
my moods 
so as to make 
an opening 
for his voice. 

Or hers. 
Muse White Goddess 
mother with invisible 
milk 
androgynous god 
in whose grip 
I struggle 
turning this way and that 
believing that I chart 
my life 
my loves 
when in fact 
it is she he 
who charts themall 
for the sake 
of some 
as yet unwritten poem. 

Twisting in the wind 
twisting like a pirate 
dangling in a cage 
from a high seawall 
the wind whips 
through my bones 
making an instrument 
my back a xylophone 
my sex a triangle 
chiming 
my lips stretched tight 
as drumskins 

I no longer care 
who is playing me 
but fear 
makes the hairs 
stand up 
on the backs 
of my hands 
when I think 
that she may stop. 

And yet I long 
for peace 
as fervently as you dothe 
sweet connubial bliss 
that admits no 
turbulence 
the settled life 
that defeats poetry 
the hearth before which 
children playnot 
poets' children 
ragtag neurotic demonridden 
but the applecheeked children 
of the bourgeoisie. 

My daughter dreams 
of peace 
as I do 
marriage proper house 
proper husband 
nourishing dreamless 
sex 
love like a hot toddy 
or an apple pie. 

But the muse 
has other plans 
for me 
and you. 

Puppet mistress 
dangling us 
on this dark proscenium 
pulling our strings 
blowing us 
toward Cornwall 
toward Venice toward Delphi 
toward some lurching 
counterpane 
a tent upheld 
by one throbbing 
blooddrenched poleher 
pen her pencil 
the monolith 
we worship 
underneath 
the gleaming moon. 

Again and again 
I have read your books 
without ever wishing to know you.

I suck the alphabet of blood. 
I chew the iron filings of your words. 
I kiss your images like moist mouths 
while the black seeds of your syllables 
fly fly fly 
into my lungs. 

Untranslated untranslatable 
you are rooted inside me
not youbut the you 
of your poems

the man of his word 
the lover who digs into the alien soil 
of one North American woman 
and plants a babylove
child of Whitman 
crossed with the Spanish language 
embryo sapling halfbreed 
of my tongue. 

I saw you once
your flesh
at Columbia. 
My alma mater 
and you the visiting soul.

Buddhalike 
you sat before a Buddha 
and the audience 
craned its neck 
to take you in. 

Freak show
visiting poet. 

You sat clothed 
in your thick 
imperious flesh.

I wanted to comfort you 
and not to stare. 
Our words knew each other. 
That was enough. 

Now you are dead 
of fascism and cancer
your books scattered 
the oil cruet on the floor.

The sea surges through your house 
at Isla Negra 
and the jackboots 
walk on water. 

Poet of cats and grapefruits 
of elephant saints 
poet of broken dishes 
and Machu Picchu 
poet of panthers 
and pantheresses 
poet of lemons 
poet of lemony light.

The flies swarm 
thicker than print on a page 
and poetry blackens 
like overripe bananas. 
The fascists you hated 
the communists you loved 
obscure the light the lemons 
with their buzzing. 

We were together 
on the side of light. 
We walked together 
though we never met. 

The eyes are not political 
nor the tastebuds 
and the flesh tastes salty always 
like the sea 
and the sea 
turns back the flies. 

Goddess I come to you 
my neck wreathed with rosebuds 
my head filled with visions of infants 
my palms open to your silver nails 
my eyes open to your rays of illumination 
my vagina and my womb gaping 
to be filled by your radiance
O goddess I would be a worthy vessel. 

Impermanence all is impermanence. 
The cock rises to fall again 
the woman fills only to empty 
in a convulsion that shakes the world 
the poet grows to become a voice 
only to lose that voice when death takes her. 
A stroke cancels her upon the pageand 
yet I open her book and a chill wind blows from eternity. 

Goddess I come to you 
wreathed in tears in losses in whistling winds. 
I wrap the witch's herbs around my neck 
to ward off the impermanence that is our common fate. 
The herbs dry and crumble 
as my face grows the map of my anxieties 
and my daughter leaps up like a vine 
twining around the trellis of impermanence. 

O goddess teach me to praise loss 
death and the passing of all things for from this flux 
I know your blessings flow. 

In Autumn 
as in Spring 
the sap flows 
the sap wishes to race 
against heartbeats 
before the winter 
before the winter 
buries us 
in her usual shroud of ice. 

I turn to you 
knowing that 
unrequited love 
is good 
for poetry 
knowing that pain 
will nudge the muse 
as well as anything 
knowing that you 
are afraid fettered 
to a life 
you do not love 
and so unfree 
that freedom seems 
more fearful even 
than the familiar 
business 
of being 
a grumbling slave. 

I lived 
that way 
once 
and I know 
that freedom 
is its own reward 
that it propagates 
itself 
by means 
of runners 

that nobody 
gives it to you 
not even me 
to you 

but that you 
must seize it 
with your own 
two quaking hands 
and pluck 
the strawberry 
it bears 
in the green 
ungrumbling 
Spring. 

I hear you will not fall in love with me 
because I come without a guarantee 
because someday I may depart at whim 
and leave you desolate abandoned grim. 
If that's the case what use to be alive? 
In loving life you love what cannot survive 
and if you grow too fond and lose your head 
it's all for noughtfor someday you'll be dead. 
Maintain a cool detachment through the years. 
Wear blinders dear put cotton in your ears. 
Since worms will taste the tongue that tastes the wine 
burst not the grape against your palate fine. 
With care your puny heart will still be whole 
the day they come to fetch your tepid soul. 
And as that strumpet Life deals her last blow 
you'll have this final consolatio 
you'll snap your flippant fingers as you fall 
and say 'I never cared for her at all' 

Not wanting to write 
for fear that anything
the passion for the page 
the love of carbon ribbons and erasers
will distract me from your face 
from your eyes green 
as the flickering base of flames 
and your tarnished copper hair. 

My love is thick as rust 
and just as hard to scrape off. 
It glows like the green roofs of paris 
it shines in the sun like dropped pennies. 

I fix on your face 
until I am blurred and bleared 
until my eyes cannot focus 
and all words become one. 

Oh let me write you into my life 
I am afraid of rust and tarnish 
but even more afraid of this gleam. 

When my eyes have taken you in 
when my body has eaten 
and spat you out 
when my heart remembers to beat 
and my fingers remember the pen

will I still remember you then 
boyish and sly
yet a total eclipse of my sun? 

The house of the body 
is a stately manor 
open for nothing 
never to the public. 

But 
for the owner of the house 
the keyholderthe 
body swings open 
like Ali Baba's mountain 
glistening with soft gold 
and red jewels. 

These cannot be stolen 
or sold for money. 
They only glisten 
when the mountain opens 
by magic 
or its own accord. 

The gold triangle of hair 
its gentle ping 
the pink quartz crystals 
of the skin 
the ruby nipples 
the lapis 
of the veins 
that swim the breast

The keyholder 
is recognized 
by the way he holds 
the body. 
He is recognized 
by touch. 

Touch is the first sense to awaken 
after the body's little death 
in sleep. 

Touch is the first sense 
to alert the raw red infant 
to a world of pain. 

The body glimmers 
on its dark mountain 
pretending ignorance of this. 

Parachuting 
down through clouds 
shaped like whales and sharks 
dolphins and penguins 
pelicans and gulls 
we reach 
the purple hills 
of a greenhearted island 
ringed 
with volcanic rock 
bathed 
by cobalt waters 
reefed 
by whitest coral 
tenanted 
by sea urchins and sponge 
and visited 
by barracuda 
and tourists. 

The dictator 
of this island 
is the sun. 
The Secret Police 
is the sweet 
fragrance of cane. 
Frangipani grows 
in the uplands 
the salt flats 
reek 
by the sea. 

I want to buy it 
to hide here 
to stay 
to teach all the people 
to write 
to orchestrate the stars 
in the palm trees 
and teach the jellyfish 
not to bite. 

Oh dark volcanic 
wine 
Oh collapsed parachute 
filled with kisses 
Oh bluebottle bits 
ground 
into jewels 
by the sand 

Whoever loves islands 
must love the sea 
and the sea 
loves no one 
but herself. 

With his head full of Shakespearean tempests 
and old notions of poetic justice 
he was ready with his elegies 
the day the ocean sailed into the square. 

'The sea' he wrote 'is a forgiving element 
and history only the old odor of blood. 
She will come to rest on the soft floor 
of the world barnacled like a great pirate ship 
and blind fishmouthing like girls before a glass
will bump perhaps San Marco's brittle bones.' 

Pleased with these images he paused 
and conjured visions of a wet apocalypse 
the blown church bobbing like a monstrous water toy 
Doge Dandolo's bronze horses from Byzantium 
pawing the black waves incredulous pigeons 
hovering like gulls over the drowning square 
mosaic saints floating gently to pieces. 

Then he waited as the wind rose as gondoliers 
were rocking in the long furrows of their boats 
and small waves licked the marble lions' eyes. 
But still this most improbable of cities 
hung on lewdly enjoying her own smell. 

Learning later how Florence with her brown bells 
her driedup joke of a river had played 
the ark to all his fantasies of flood 
he felt a little foolish. He was walking 
in the gallery then thinking of the doges 
how they tread on clouds which puff and pucker 
like the flesh of their fat Venetian whores 
how thanks to Tintoretto's shrewd old eyes 
they saw themselves amid the holy saints 
how shrewd old Tintoretto for a price 
painted his patrons into paradise. 

All over the district on leather couches 
and brocade couches on daybeds 
and professional divans they are confessing. 
The air is thick with it 
the ears of analysts must be sticky. 

Words fill the air above couches and hover there 
hanging like smog. I imagine 
impossible Steinberg scrolls 
unutterable sounds suspended in inked curlicues 
while the Braque print and the innocuous Utrillo 
look on look on look on. 

My six analysts for example

the sly Czech who tucked his shoelaces 
under the tongues of his shoes 
the mistress of social work with orange hair 
the famous old german who said 
You sink zerefore you are
the bouncy American who loved to talk dirty 
the bitchy widow of a famous theoretician 
and anotheror was it two?I have forgotten
they rise like a Greek chorus in my dreams. 
They reproach me for my messy life. 
They do not offer to refund my money. 

and the otherssiblings for an hour or so
ghosts whom I brushed in and out of the door. 
Sometimes the couch was warm from their bodies. 
Only our coats knew each other 
rubbing shoulders in the dark closet. 

We learned the decorum of fire 
the flame's curious symmetry 
the blue heat at the center of the thighs 
the flickering red of the hips 
and the tallow gold of the breasts 
lit from within 
by the lantern in the ribs. 

You tear yourself out of me 
like a branch that longs to be grafted 
onto a fruit tree 
peach and pear 
crossed with each other 
fig and banana served on one plate 
the leaf and the luminous snail 
that clings to it. 

We learned that the tearing 
could be a joining 
that the fire's flickering 
could be a kindling 
that the old decorum of loveto 
die into the poem 
leaving the lover lonely with her penwas 
all an ancient lie. 

So we banished the evil eye 
you have to be unhappy to create 
you have to let love die before it writes 
you have to lose the joy to have the poem and
we rewrote our lives with fire. 

See this manuscript covered 
with fleshcolored words? 
It was written in invisible ink 
and held up to our flame. 

The words darkened on the page 
as we sank into each other. 

We are ink and blood 
and all things that make stains. 
We turn each other golden as we turn 
browning each other's skins like suns. 

Hold me up to the light 
you will see poems. 

Hold me in the dark 
you will see light. 

What You Need To Be A Writer 

After the college 
reading 
the eager 
students gather. 

They ask me 
what you need 
to be a writer 

and I feeling flippant 
jaunty 
because 
I am wearing 
an 18th century 
dress 
and think 
myself in love 
again 
answer 

Mazel 
determination 
talent and true 
grit.

I even 
believe it

looking 
as I do 
like an 
advertisement 
for easy 
success

designer dress 
sly smile 
on my lips 
and silver boots 
from 
Oz. 

Suppose 
they saw me 
my eyes 
swollen 
like sponges 
my hand 
shaking 
with betrayal 

my fear 
rampant 
in the dark? 

Suppose they saw 
the fear 
of never 
writing 
the fear 
of being 
alone 
the money fear 
the fear fear 
the fear 
of succumbing 
to fear? 

and then there's all 
I did 
not say 

to be 
a writer 
what you need 
is 

something 
to say 

something 
that burns 
like a hot coal 
in your gut 

something 
that pounds 
like a pump 
in your groin 

and the courage 
to love 
like a wound 

that never 
heals. 

When I am an old lady 
the young men 
will come to me 
and sit trembling 
at my trembling 
feet 
saying 

you must have been 
beautiful 
when you were young 
you must have been 
a wonderful loverand 
perhaps 
they will still feel 
that current 
which you say 
passes from me 
to you 
and which you give back 
doubled 
on our wild 
afternoons. 

The madness 
will still be there
the current of sex 
of poetry of heroism
which is only 
another name 
for God 
passing through us
God Goddess 
whoever 
we call Her

that ancient lady 
who sits above the world 
spinning out 
our destinies. 

She looped your life 
around mine 
she took the weft 
of your need 
and gave me 
the bright threads 
to weave you 
into my life

old Circe 
playing music on her loom 
and weaving men 
into her glittering 
tapestry. 

Woven into her cloth 
still 
they feel free. 
Bewitched by her poems 
still 
they feel strong. 
Drunk on her Pramnian wine 
still 
they feel clear
as if they were marching 
through life 
alone. 

But it is she 
who guides them 
leading them 
now by their cocks 
now by their hearts 
now by swinishness

but what does she feel 
alone 
on her cloud throne? 
She feels lonely. 
Lonely to know 
all she knows 
and lonely even being loved 
by so many 

sleepy 
beasts. 

In dreams I descend 
into the cave of my past 
a child with a morguetag 
on its toe 
the terrible metal squeaking 
of the morguedrawers 
and the chilly basement 
and the slam of doors. 

Or else I am setting up dreamhouse 
with the wife 
of my second exhusband. 
She complains of him 
with breaking sorrowand 
I comfort her. 
She only married him it seems for me. 

Sometimes I wake up naked 
in Beverly Hills
the table set for ten a formal dinner
a studio chief on my left side 
a fabled actor on my right. 
Across the table 
Greta Garbo Scott Fitzgerald 
John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe


and I alone not properly dressed for dinner 
and besides unprepared 
for the final exam 
in which our immortality 
will be tested 
and one of us shall perish 
as dessert. 

Send parachutes and kisses 

Send them quick 
I am descending into the cave 
of my own fear. 
My feet are weighted 
with the legirons of the past. 
The elevator plummets 
in the shaft. 

trapped trapped in the bowels 
of my dream 
locked in the cellar 
by myself the jailer. 
Rats and spiders scuttle 
through the coal bin. 
I cower in the corner. 

I am fear. 

Because my grandmother's hours 
were apple cakes baking 
and dust motes gathering 
and linens yellowing 
and seams and hems 
inevitably unraveling 
I almost never keep house 
though really I like houses 
and wish I had a clean one. 

Because my mother's minutes 
were sucked into the roar 
of the vacuum cleaner 
because she waltzed with the washerdryer 
and tore her hair waiting for repairmen 
I send out my laundry 
and live in a dusty house 
though really I like clean houses 
as well as anyone. 

I am woman enough 
to love the kneading of bread 
as much as the feel 
of typewriter keys 
under my fingers 
springy springy. 
and the smell of clean laundry 
and simmering soup 
are almost as dear to me 
as the smell of paper and ink. 

I wish there were not a choice 
I wish I could be two women. 
I wish the days could be longer. 
But they are short. 
So I write while 
the dust piles up. 

I sit at my typewriter 
remembering my grandmother 
and all my mothers 
and the minutes they lost 
loving houses better than themselves 
and the man I love cleans up the kitchen 
grumbling only a little 
because he knows 
that after all these centuries 
it is easier for him 
than for me. 

My friends are tired. 
The ones who are married are tired 
of being married. 
The ones who are single are tired 
of being single. 

They look at their wrinkles. 
The ones who are single attribute their wrinkles 
to being single. 
The ones who are married attribute their wrinkles 
to being married. 

They have very few wrinkles. 
Even taken together 
they have very few wrinkles. 
But I cannot persuade them 
to look at their wrinkles 
collectively. 
and I cannot persuade them that being married 
or being single 
has nothing to do with wrinkles. 

Each one sees a deep and bitter groove 
a San Andreas fault across her forehead. 
It is only a matter of time 
before the earthquake. 
They trade the names of plastic surgeons 
like recipes. 

My friends are tired. 
The ones who have children are tired 
of having children. 
The ones who are childless are tired 
of being childless. 

They love their wrinkles. 
If only their were deeper 
they could hide. 

Sometimes I think 
but do not dare to tell them 
that when the face is left alone to dig its grave 
the soul is grateful 
and rolls in. 

You hate the telephone 
but will not see me 
face to face 
so I am left 
beseeching you 
longdistance 
trying to thread our love 
along the telephone poles 
of Vermont 
trying to tunnel it 
under the Atlantic 
as if it were 
a rare fossil 
I had unearthed 
or an offshore pipe 
bearing precious oil. 

But it is your face 
I love 
your funny grin 
that now seems 
cruel around the edges. 
You do not wish to be 
cruelyou 
the kindest person in the world 
but driven to curious 
rages 
when you feel 
pressured frustrated 
saddled with 
an albatross of love 
like an ancient 
mariner 
who tells his same sad story 
to the wedding guests. 

The telephone will not 
suffice. 
Coleridge would have 
loathed it 
and so would his 
mariner. 
It is our modern 
Person from Porlock 
interrupting poems 
interrupting loves 
and forever 
keeping us at arm's length. 

I would look you in the eye 
again saying yes yes yes
we have said no enough 
for the rest 
of many lifetimes. 

You operate on the afternoon 
You perform open heart surgery 
on the ghosts 
of your suicidal friends 

You divorce your parents 
before you have time 
to be born 

You kick out your wife and child 
You tell your girlfriend 
to go screw herself 

This is the solitude you wanted 
The silence 
is stitching you up 
you write 

You whom I hoped to reach by writing 
you beyond the multicolored tangle 
of telephone wires 
you with your white paper soul 
trampled in transit 
you with kaleidoscope stamps 
and black cancellations 
you who put your finger on my heart as I slept 
you whom I jostle in elevators 
you whom I stare at in subways 
you shopping for love in department stores

I write to you 
and someone else answers 
the man who hates his wife 
and wants to meet me 
the girl who mistakes me for mother
My strange vocation 
is to be paid for my nightmares. 

I write to you my love 
and someone else 
always answers. 

Letting the mind go 
letting the pen the breath 
the movement of images in and out 
of the mouth 
go calm go rhythmic 
as the rise and fall of waves 
as one sits in the lotus position 
over the world 
holding the pen so lightly 
that it scarcely stains the page 
holding the breath 
in the glowing cage of the ribs 
until the heart 
is only a living lantern 
fueled by breath 
and the pen writes 
what the heart wills 
and the whole world goes out 
goes black 
but for the hard clear stars 
below.
