
 

Underneath the sun's chroma 	
and gold streaks
we throw stones
into the ocean of life
hoping somewhere in
midst of the waves
we will cross our paths
across a bank on a ship
or just remain
swimming throughout our lives
 
When I die
take away my heart
the kidneys and eyes
Do not burn
whatever is left of me
the skin the tissues and
the intestines
Bury me deep
in the brown soil
let plants and trees
grow out of me
Then I will RIP
knowing that
my dead body was
more useful than
my living one
 
September
Dissolved in love
Footfalls on my soul
Me a mad wave roaring
on ethereal love waters

October
I surrendered in love
he smiled in derision
I was a piece of toilet paper
used and stashed

November
Pitted a walking carcass
breeding spite
on the tip of my tongue
deliberating reckoning about

December
Resolved not to love again
reduced to embers
In all these ‘ember’ months
waiting for the new year to spring

Some days I wait
for the night to open
a theater of galaxies
and stars
I sit on the roof
and gaze at them
and wonder
how beautiful they are
and how hollow they are
at the same time
bags of gases
exploding held
by their gravity
inside
and magnificent
outside
Just like me
fighting thousands
of battles
inside
but putting my
best look
outside

This place that I called home
now a cauldron of bones
This place where my roots are
now a burrow of haunted memoirs
This place where my ancestors lived
now a history forgotten
These ruins these remnants
have been a part of me all along
and someday the seeds of today
will visit these remaining bricks
to find peace to seek wisdom
to know their roots
just like me
I will be then a photograph on the wall
next to my forefathers
covered in dust
waiting to be wiped and to be known

We built our love on the tomb of your ex-wife
We sowed the seeds of our marriage in her earth
We took away her vermilion and adored my forehead
You and she were growing old
and you abandoned her for a young wife
I was happy to marry you
and enjoyed watching you
kick her out of your house

She walked away with tears in her eyes
and gave us one parting gift  The glass Taj Mahal
The Taj Mahal was given to her as a wedding gift
and now she returned it back
as it was now mere ruins of her love

The glass Taj Mahal sits in the shelf
reminding you and me of
what we had done to her

Bit by bit piece by piece
our love shrinks our love drowns
 
Will our love become a tomb too?
Built on our wishes and desires
and unsatisfied expectations?
Will I be kicked out of the house too?
 
I reside in this constant fear
We fight we argue we shout at each other

Block by block our relationship tumbles down
Honey the Taj Mahal stays on
and we are being crushed by the weight of it

I float on amber waters
a fossil of sins
a grave of regrets
Sometimes a butterfly flutters
but my black tongue slurps it
Hunger is a pack of needs

The cadence of hope
the slaughter of light
You may ask me
why I have turned
spiteful and malevolent?

My answers will surprise you

Honey you are a fresh breeze
pure waiting to fall in love
but I am a toxic resin
a by-product of love

They say I sinned
by loving her
by touching her
by worshipping her
I was forced to resign
from loving her
being with her

But tell me
Can you stop loving someone
whom you loved more than yourself imagined?

She was taken from me
mercilessly
and here you see me
a tombstone mourning eternally
waiting for her
But let not the amber light
fail you we know the poison it can hold

Let your love spread topaz moon
pearls and emeralds
You are the dew drop
and I am the Black Sea
I begged you to stay away
but you came closer
and turned those amber waters
into a serene azure

Can we take a second chance
in the sapphire light
glowing with shades of blue
bubbling with life

I can leave the amber sky
on a bright summer day
at the door of a temple
hoping that a painter
would someday
paint a picture
A tapestry of failed love
hoping for a second chance

I love you each day
just a little more
and as big as the light years
 
I am a firefly trapped in a glass jar
and I was put there to protect me from a bear paw
Am I to be a bloom of rhododendrons confined to a bonsai plant? I wonder

My mother did not teach me to be wild to be careless reckless
Instead she taught me to be subdued
not to look at the sky but keep my eyes fixed on shiny tiles
Did she want to shield me protect me from the vampires of this world
for whom I could be a never ending blood bag
I wonder

Did she not know an eagle has to soar high it can't be made to walk?
Did she not know tears will become waterfalls and with them they will carry everything in their way?
Did she not know weeds though picked from garden will still grow?
Did she not know that an eclipse cannot be stopped no matter what it shadows the sun?

I never found the answers
but I do know

Beneath a nine yards sari is a warrior princess
She carries a sword tipped with tungsten edges on fire
In every pleat of the sari lies courage bravery strength valor tied to her body
The sari is not just to cover her to add grace
it masks the fire she carries within

Mamma do not worry let me be wild
open the jar in which you protect me
do not clip my wings
you do not see the rage in my eyes
Let me become the mighty waterfall
Let me be would you at all?
 
The sea grows on me
its roar its turbulence
and its depth
My tranquility is
lost in its abyss
What stays
are the rough tides

I wear layers of invisible skin
Each layer is a test
and every test will bring you closer to me
You must unwrap each cover
to discover the gift
You see this has been a slow process
to build walls around me
It took years to fortify myself
to become immune
And one day you come along
and demand my love
The layers block you
keep you away from me
You blame me for being a hard-to-get girl
You want easy?
You want me to fall into your arms?
Just like that without any filters

But these filters are my sunscreens
protecting me from the unworthy
Love to me is Knighthood
and I can’t be yours
for you treat love as a mere pawn


Your poems are daggers piercing my hear he had said
I replied they are the ramblings of an unworthy soul

That was our first conversation
inconsequential to me
but slowly
in all the mortar and all the bricks
and the debris of a fragmented city
that lay fallen and disintegrated in my heart
flew back in a backward deconstruct

He not only rebuilt it
but also glorified it with
millions of lanterns

He then smiled and said
I showed you how to build
Now it is up to you to build more
or let this one topple
 
Midnight sings to me the songs of Hell
I look at my reflection in the mirror a well
running deep into the belly of the earth
where one must burn the soul in its hearth
and then the mirror speaks
reveals and unmasks
 
I lay bare on the dressing table
one-by-one a name and a label
with the accessories and make-up
I spread my thoughts from the lock-up
I peel from my face all its luster
and with it all the needless clutter
 
I remove my hair pins which pricked me all day
all my fears unwrapped rest now at bay
I strip my clothes off my bare skin flashed
drops with it my fake persona and ugly lies stashed
Tonight let me sleep to the midnight song
A bare body and a naked mind along
 
My scars are scarlet rings
invisible puffs of smoke with stings
dreams smothered beneath my burnt wings
my remains silenced a nest of dead things

I scratch my scars and watch my blood ooze
I give up I quit I put myself on a moment's snooze
like a scarecrow's robe fluttering in the wind loose
sipping the last drops from a dirty bottle of wine my last booze

Marooned in a desert in the shadows of lost dreams
afraid to let go of the oceans I held in my palms
drowning in my own blood that sings psalms
and chides me of how easily I have ended my life in my own arms

A shame a crime my shadow on the opposite wall mocks
I sip a few more drops pull up my socks
to be martyred fighting on the rocks
I touch my wounds I take to wings breaking all locks

I remind myself I was not meant to hide my scars
I was meant to be a war cry the roar of roars

This house closes on me its walls are about to come down
This house is still fragrant with the scent of your memories
This house weeps every night its sniffles reverberate the entire night
This house is tumbling down the tiles on the roof slide down during the day in your commemoration
This bed on which I sleep wakes to your touch every night
This pillow that I rest my head on is used to your curls caressing it
These wind chimes hanging on the window sill mourn at the lightest breeze
This dressing table mirror keeps reflecting your lovely form
This green sofa in the drawing room still holds the open book that you left on it
This dining table misses the aroma the spices and the flavors of your hand cooked meal
This painting on the stairs a shepherd looking after the lambs now awaits your return
This floor yearns to listen to the sound of your feet the anklets jingling along
This house and everything within it is dying wrapped in the shroud of your memories
 
That bare noon
I waited for the rain
somewhere crickets crooned
bees buzzed to fill their bellies
a butterfly broke out from its chrysalis

A magpie sat on my window sill
pecking at a marble I had left there
Just one for sorrow not two for joy?
And then not too late there was a pair
And the day it was to be happy

Clouds crowded the sky
like guests for
free wine and dine

And then big fat drops
on the window sill
drenched that marble

I made a paper boat to
float in the tiny puddle
that had formed on
the road beneath my window

My mother came out running
with an umbrella
yelling and shouting
her child was wet

Years went by the marble
the paper boat of scrap
the window sill the road
grew old along with me

Even this afternoon is nude
waiting to happen
somewhere a mobile rings
a new email on my laptop flickers
a butterfly breaks open
but never flies

Magpies never visit
this busy place
The marble keeps rolling
like the hands of the clock
There is rain and there are puddles
but I do not make paper boats anymore
 
These lonely nights
wind swirls like an old mate
creatures of the night
keep me company
an ant plays on my toes
from a corner of my eye
I see a cockroach
coming out of its hideout
and did a rat pass by?
The whiskey bottle
beckons me to slip
in the world of illusions

One bottle down
I am a gazelle
An eagle a butterfly
Everything in the pocket
of my mind
in a coiled body of flesh
lying in litter while
cockroaches and ants
use my flesh as a bridge
and rats nibble at my fingers
 
Wild kisses foreplays
Night blushes interludes beckon
Dreams play in silhouettes
                                                                                                            
Drink them I tell him
Feel my nude thoughts intercept
Plant them on my body

My body a harp
Sings to the tune your lips play
In your arms I die

Death is not the end
I will become the wild wind
Settling like a halo around you

That’s my promise to you
For now let's live in this moment
Let me die in love and let me die to live
 
Let her flow
like the stream
Don’t contain her
for she will look
for tiny gaps
and crevices
Let her carve
her own path
Don’t give her a road
because she doesn’t believe
in following the footsteps
Let her gush
and settle
Don’t give her rules
as she likes to dance in the green plains
and fall from the rocky hills
Let her be
what she is
Don’t be afraid to lose her
for she is the stream
and she will find her way to the ocean

You
a body of lies
and I have been
searching for truth
all my life
Never found it
but instead
got entangled
into the web
I do not know
anymore
what is lie
what is truth
All I feel
is my bones
cracking
my skin
falling apart
I live in a grave
where maggots
of lies
feed on me
 
Time swells on me
Like a fresh corpse
On its way to decompose
 
It stands still
A moor of gravel
And fossil
 
Time reaps death
Stripping life forth
Right out of its sheath
 
Time says you are dead
Let me lead
You and the thread
 
That connects to the world
No more you can hold
And then I get swirled
 
Into a black slimy cocoon
Time gnarled in this lagoon
A fresh start of a new moon
 
It’s cool light piercing the drapes
As I wake up from a long nap
As the doctor is about to wrap
 
Me in a shroud of white
Seeing my eyes glitter with light
He takes a hurried flight
 
The hospital staff my family and me
Thank the Gods and the time
For being still for minutes nine
 
When death sang its psalm
As I crossed the other realm
Staying firm at the helm
 
Yet it wasn't my time
Time continued to swell on me
And it brought me back just fine
 
A chandelier of love
glitters dazzles
falls shatters;
and in the broken
shards
I see a million
smiles
Yours
 
In my palms I hold memories
 
A thread of the nylon ribbon
that held your hair in
two pigtails in class fourth
 
A bead from the necklace
that adored your tall slender
neck on the 10th class
farewell party
 
A yellow frayed torn piece
of a handmade greeting
that you gave me
on my 18th birthday
 
A bubblegum wrapper
how we spent hours
chewing listening to
the boring lectures
 
An old movie ticket
how we bunked
the classes for
the movies
 
An old kerchief
that wiped the tears
of all of us on the
college farewell day
 
On this reunion day
I will gather a few more
moments for
another lifetime
 
She was a firefly
trapped in a jar
 
I had to just
open the lid
 
She became
Radiance

Silence speaks to me
like a mockingbird
mimicking the emptiness
in which I dwell
 
to bleach my thoughts
before I express them
to filter my words
on the tip of my tongue
to withhold myself every time
I feel like a wave breaking onto the rocks
to erase what I had written
out of pure feelings and floods of emotions
to be tamed and chained
when I yearn to wander into the woods
to have my wings clipped
when my heart soars in the sky
to have me contained
to the four walls of a house
just to please you my love
 
If you love me love me
for what I am
as I am
the raw unpolished me
with all my layers
and complexities
and then I will
give all of me to you
 
The only way to have all of me
is to let me be and love the way I am

There is so much
of love around me
yet a void penetrates
my soul
 
Like a stone
tied to my leg
sinking me
to the seabed
 
Perhaps
I think too much
I react too much
and that is how
I have lost
my buoyancy

I
always
find
a
word
to
seduce
me
and
then
the
foreplay
begins
the
climax
a
POEM
 
Trails of wax
will tell you
how I have
burned for you
 
Hurry
before I reduce
to an extinguished wick

I daydream
I picture you
in front of me
with your guitar
singing songs
written by me
 
My dream
is broken
by the chimes
that play
wildly
by the wind
 
And then
an eerie silence
engulfs all;
the wind
the chimes
me and the
memories of you

It was time to say bye
and so I packed everything
that I could
 
I packed a bit of you
and left most of mine
 
Where dew drops of time
fall on the leaf of life
I will cage you
in my dreams
 
My dreams perch
over a rainbow
and when it rains
these tiny droplets
of dreams of you
will settle on my
face and hair
like shining
pearls of love

At your altar I falter
to confess my sins
 
The demons inside me
hold me back
 
The creep into my bones
and peel away my sanity
 
A black rain sweeps me
into Hell’s whirlpool
 
I pray
 
If loving you means
draining out my
mental
physical
and
soul energy
 
I quit

There is rain
and
there are tears
 
Mirrors break
and
dreams shatters
 
Flowers wither
and
hope fades
 
There is life
and
life goes on
 
I let him win
I lost
in love
to love
 
Is there a redemption?
NO
Will he ever come back?
NO
 
LOSER
BIG TIME
BEING US
 
Being yourself
and being myself
if not working out
let us fake ourselves
and then will
we be able to stand
each other?
Should we go
to that extent
for love
for retaining
us together
 
Outside the wind howls
Inside silence growls
wild bats play their tune
this eerie night of June
 
I ask
what is darker?
the night outside
or the night inside ME
 
Days grow
like lazy mushrooms
on a decaying log
sleeping in my yard
 
Seeing them I wonder
will they grow on
my decaying body
when I am dead?
 
And hopefully
a poor peasant
plucks and cooks them
to feed his famished family
 
Bits and pieces of us
scattered all over
and we spend
a lifetime
collecting them back
 
You were summer
I was rain
together we
become exquisite
me a sonorous voice
you a melting tone
 
I do not belong to this city
of concrete jungles
fake smiles and
masked corporate libidos
of cement roads trendy cars
rattling traffic with road rage
wars for an inch of space
of sophisticated neckties boasting
of their luxurious flats and shallow decorum
of polluted lakes hardly any left
where people place wagers
on water tankers
 
where cabs witness brutal rapes and roads
carry the blood of honor killings
of being punctual to meetings
but perpetually late for taking care
of elderly folks
 
where young folks rot in air-conditioned cabins
and the old rot on their beds
glued to television
of structural silos where
plastic coated skirts and beards lurk
in branded clothes and spas
but refuse to spend even a dime
on knowledge and wisdom
 
of drugs sex and real estate mafia
where these have become acceptable when compared to children being robbed from their childhood by pedophiles
 
I do not belong to this city but I continue to reside here doing nothing about its degenerative state of decay
 
perhaps I am too much dead to feel things to bring a change
 
Shadows speak in muffled voices
a constant reminder of all that you are guilty of
 
A lot
can go
wrong
with us
But I will
try to right
my wrong
Will you too?
 
If there is love
then why do
we hate each other
If there is affection
then why do
we drift away from each other
If there is truth
then why do
we lie to each other?
 
If there is respect
then why do we throw
mud at each other?
If there is beauty
then why do we
see only the ugly side?
If we have GOD
then why do
we need religion?
And lastly when
death is the final destination
why are we so much
attached to life?
 
Amidst the spring of love
dreams run amok
braced with hope;
Rhododendrons bloom
of ecstasy and glee
Tomorrow is golden
spent in lover’s embrace
 
These days
I feel like
a feather
floating
in the zenith
of sorrow
The feather
then
becomes
the quill
bleeding
poems of
you

My sunset is doped
dipped in dark crimson
He asks innocently
'why isn't yours
black like mine?'
His naivety!
I continue to bleed

The floor is strewn with
juice and the pip of the fruits
like an old hag's spells scattered all over
counting her last breaths
 
The apple the mighty one looked whole
but the rear end of it scourged badly
 
The grapes that adorned the pretty basket once now reduced to a pulpy mess
 
The orange its sections spread all over
now devoid of its juices
 
The banana presently reduced to a grounded coarse chutney
 
The juice from the pomegranate seeds draw weird figures on the wall
 
The strawberries distorted
The peach skewed
 
Some of the pieces of these fruits
stuck to the chappals which walked
on this very floor
or carried by the stylish stilettos
or crushed further by the flat soles
of the shining shoes recently polished
and the owner cursing the fruits
 
But it wasn't the fruits who fell by themselves
someone threw them and stomped them in anger and frustration
The cleaners moped and wiped the floor
to restore the old clean sparkling look
must be the little scoundrels they thought
 
Or it could be
some unknown ghost
or a frustrated deranged soul from the party
knocking his fury out at the innocent fruits laid out on the table as part of buffet
 
When I look at all that mess I wonder
aren't we the crushed fruits
stomped by a giant foot called
LIFE

I dip my palms in yellow paint
the color of fire
to purify them
of the dirty dreams of you
they held till yesterday
 
I scrape my soles
with tincture and charcoal
to exfoliate them
from the flakes of
a wrong path followed
 
I cover myself in
a black burkha
hiding the marks
of your physical
infestation on my body
 
I bathe myself
in antiseptics and
holy water to get
rid of your soul
trapped in my heart
 
I sleep on the
bed of thorns
at night to
remind me of not
to love you ever again

STRANDED
In love
 
TRADED
by lust greed
 
SUBMERGED
Morals and ethics
 
REMAINED
Dead people walking
 
My summers are foggy
winters are scorching days
ambushed by your thoughts
nights still in moments we spent together
 
I am MOSS
feeding on your dead memories

Do not offer your hearts at my feet
I am not capable of loving you back
the way you want me to love you
 
I am a witch who will claim your soul
I have lost my ability to trust men
to appreciate any good gesture
which only fans the tendrils of desire
ultimately paving for a limerance
 
Can you see beyond my pretty face?
Can you see the scars underneath my skin?
Can you be a silent shadow who does not expect anything?
Can you spend a whole night in the same room without touching me?
 
I see it pointless even to ask you these questions
And in silence I carry an umbrella
to shield myself from the raining hearts that are just a flock of owls hooting at their own delusions

You change the pace of my life
Everything appears in slow motion
Bubbles bursting in the air
Specks of dust floating in the beam of light
The crow flapping its wings
 
You change the rhythm of my feelings
There is music in noise of
the whistles of the pressure cooker
the honking and the traffic sounds on a busy day
the static on telephone
 
You change the sentience of my dreams
they have converged into reality
the sand castle is my home now
I keep falling but now I land in your arms
And they lived happily thereafter is possible

You will never know
how it is to stay in one
and never feel like home
Four walls a door
and a few windows
A name plate with
Mr and Mrs Iyer
Letters shimmering
on a metallic background
 
Lovely couple
people say
My teeth sparkle
but the tongue mocks at
my fake smile
There are dry scars
through which pain shears
and fresh bruises where
blood sporadically sprinkles
Abetting the burnt ecstasy
of my thighs
all well hidden under the clothes
and at places where no one can see
 
Peer at my naked body
you will writhe in pain
It is now a painting
of scars and marks
Little trinkets of
bad memories
which will accompany
to my last days
Tears trickle no more
for my body has become numb
As I excel in fakes
My face is veiled always
hidden under which
is a sea of pain
 
Sometimes when the masks tend to fall
and my bruises rise up against my inner wall
I glue it up fiercely
so the mirror does not know me wholly
for it is eternally ignorant
that my own luxurious flat
Is a morphed shit hole
A sex slave reduced only to a sole
 
A Toy that is abused
beaten and thrashed
Death would be my eternal abode
in whose arms I shall reside in peace
Liberated free from pain and burns
a solace for which my heart yearns
A cold place where I keep my soul warm
and so fire beckons me to burn in it
But am I robbing my sisters of their future?
 
What will they be labelled hereafter?
Should they too be branded a suicidal drifter
Ah what fancy words
elicited by fancy souls
Truth is forbidden
Found in association
residing with graves
deluding the earthly souls
Better be dead then
world brims with pain when
 
Yellow is my valentine
born out of the petals
of the blooming sunflower
drinking the golden milk of the sun
The font of the OM
smeared across the space
The sky rolls into a
tangy lemon over the horizon
gathering yellow mass of stars
The fire in my belly
crackles and splinters out
yellow rain drenches me
in sublime pristine bliss
The blessings are yellow
showered by turmeric dust
the feet and hands dipped in yellow water
The soul dances in yellow beams
balancing on the yellow edges of existence
Memories and thoughts are yellow
bathed in sandalwood incense
Ask me the color of my Aura
and I will say yellow
 
Another dank evening
shades of grey turn coal
Another dank walk
The moist grass crushes
under the stomp of my numb feet
I return to my room empty handed
 
The room the walls
the bed and the blankets
dank from the chilly night
My body danker than all of these
The telephone is dank too
Silent from past three days
 
Dank is my old soul;
forgotten
abandoned
Hope too is dank
for there have been no visitors
since the past three days
Not that I would answer the
telephone ring or the doorbell
 
The spirit too is dank
watching my dead body
dank under the blankets
waiting to be found
and cremated
ON AND OFF
 
We cross paths again
we fell in love again
we parted again
Maybe we were never meant
to be together
Before now after
We were just co-passengers
meeting at different intersections
when we lost someone
we found each other
and then we lost us again
to find someone else
I guess we will never
be satisfied with each other
and with anyone else
We both will meet again
to part again
and we both will
blame someone else again
 
I will leave my mark
In the poems I weave
 
I will leave a trace of me
In the snippets I write
 
I will leave bread crumbs here and there
In my short stories and novels
 
You can find a part of me in all of them
while I am walking on this earth
 
And when I cease walking
I will be the breeze;
blowing and settling next to the reader
laughing and crying with them
 
Let me snug in to you
cuddle in your warmth
Winter nights are here again
And you fit me
like an old sweater
 
It rains in thick sheets seasonal and unseasonal both swelling like two big blobs on an ugly face a polestar fallen in the north clueless directionless why and what purpose it hath in this life broth

A face that resembles more of the abandoned father and much less the helpless and destitute mother battered one that haunts all three of us at night a face that matters yet does not matter

When he was with us he beat us both in all the ways he could I reminded him of all that he wasn't and all that he should days we slept licking our wounds in the rain and cold dreaming of food alone in the woods

And one day he left us to die grabbing all the money that my mother hid from him cans of rice and flour and earthen pots It was then I prayed that he must never return to die of gunshots

Just like that night it is raining outside God's ire A life cursed for unknown sins; left to die a bit more in this shire condemned God is like my father who hates my face and left me to burn daily in fire

Inside the thatched house we cry mother and daughter at our fate I pray destiny to pity me erasing and rewriting my slate as I hold on to the thin frayed thread of hope for a miracle before it is not too late

There is a big hole that needs a patch up in the thatched roof
The money instead went for a patch up work for my mother's ailing body a proof of our beggarly life feeding on our endurance and resilience like a hungry wolf
 
And so it rains in thick sheets inside the small hut I collect the water in an old rickety plastic bucket But there are several small holes in the roof that can't be shut

I see my swollen face that resembles him a constant torture if he is alive he is probably spending last of his dime on a whore who too has a stomach to feed and sells herself lost on the life shore
 
The two ugly blobs stare back at me in the mirror It rains in thick sheets Inside and outside within and beyond wet; wet not just the floor and roof wet in the mind wet in the soul…
 
An imperfect
today
of perfect love
yesterday
 
Today we meet again
as strangers
shaking hands
pretending
 
My quest for love
always ends in me
becoming
a pawn for sex
 
Lies in every corner
every nook in this city
This place where I have grown
is dead it reeks of sex and love is
crumpled and thrown in a sewer
 
Sunsets
A flock of birds
returning home
Two lovers
walk in shadows
Hand-in-hand
hiding their affair
A new saga
of old lovers
begins
a story spins

A torn letter
A dusty diary
Few words
Few poems
 
Forgotten
In time
Lost…
 
Roll the dice
let us play it nice
let the love games begin
for a price
 
In the game of love
we win or loose
either way it hurts
an option you choose
 
And I am forced to play
my love for you was pure
before you showed your ugly side
and now you will suffer for sure
 
We buried our love
deep in the earth
calling it an end
 
After many years
the earth stirred
and churned
 
throwing out
the dead love
like a half
 
rotten corpse
that could be
still revived
 
that day
we found
our earth
 
our sky
for us
within us
 
I knew flying kites was his hobby
 
What I didn’t know was that disguised in his hobby was his passion to leave the kites stranded in midair and watch them fall helplessly
 
Do not love me in pieces and in installments
Do not peel me off my layers
 
Love all of me with my complexities
my flaws and my imperfections
And I will allow you a ride of this
beautiful mind where thoughts are
stacked in tiny pockets and as you
unravel each thought each emotion
each feeling will be revealed
You will not only find yourself but will
also help me find my real SELF
 
Together we shall explore a new sky
every day leaving our footprints
As love constellations

In your arms
I have found
my dreams
 
In my dreams
I have caged
your love
 
In your love
time melts
into a moment
 
And in that
Moment
life dwells
 
Wild flowers grow in the
crevices of hard rocks
 
My love too can make
way in your stone heart
 
Attacked by lewd comments
staring eyes stripping off her dress
she objects and voices against it
only to be molested and abused
 
The passers-by ignore her
as it is none of their business
but pause and take pictures and videos
to post on Facebook and Whatsapp
 
She screams for help
and the sky bleeds with her
a flock of birds cry in pain
and nature sighs in regret
 
But humans keep taking pictures
and satisfied with a good pic they leave
as if it was none of their business
but happy to shoot the cruel act
 
She is groped beaten and raped
as if she deserved it
Tears in her eyes and numb to the pain
She asks
 
would you do this or let it happen
if it were your mother or daughter
You allowed a daughter to be violated
and humanity weeps with her
DEAD SOUL
 
The melody in music is long gone
what is left is only the noise
The sweetness in our voice is long dead
what is left is only the scream
 
The day is lost
to the shadows of the night
and the night has
turned itself into a giant pall
 
Every day we wake up to our dreams
stepping on the tombs of our souls
vying against the lively zombies
and reminding ourselves we are alive

Sparks ignite
beneath the navel
closer to the heart
I submerge in fireworks

on fleshed papyrus
we hear
a poem interlaced
a moonlight tryst
rhymed staccato breath
 
I never quite understand
the climax of life
I imagine sometimes
How does it feel to die?
 
Death is a giant bubble maker
It sucks the life out
and makes a
Bubble from it
 
Bubbles of different colors
Red blue green black white grey
The color of the bubble
is the color of our soul
 
The soul entrapped in it
we float in the void
Multiple bubbles floating for
millions of years
 
We don’t dash against each other
We are just afloat asleep
And when we are ready
the bubble breaks
 
And we slid into
another bubble the womb
Again floating for nine months
we are reborn
 
The color of our bubble
assumes our character
And once again the cycle starts
Only to end in a bubble and to begin again
 
In my soft arms you pine for him
There are trials you can never hide
In his you show our love marks on your bare back
 
For eff’s sake choose which wound
you want to fester or share this dark disaster
 
I still hear as you moan in the dark
his name and monikers to me Eve…
 
Take off the mask of love
Sex is what you seek
Let us lay our cards on the table
You want a naked body
I want a naked soul

This hot summer night
I soak in sweat
May you arrive like rain
and quench my parched body
 
I left the door ajar
for you to slip in
The husband snores
I burn in raging fire
 
My thighs will give way
and so my breasts
seeking freedom
from my blouse
 
The night grows
the snoring rises
mercury soars
a few degrees more
 
And thus the carnal
ink writes a story
on the canvass
This body
 
A poem locked in a prison
a silent verse hidden
waiting to be unveiled

Eros arrives
a thunder spark
in the quiet night sky

A poem shapes
black pearls
on a white canvass

of desires
and longings;
wanton lust

My body
waits
to be taken

Memories and feelings to her are sounds
Oh! Sight is not within her bounds
It matters not whether it's night or day
everything is black before her sightless eyes anyway

She remembers the day when her parents parted ways
the sound of the sea the splash on the rocks stays
Her parents forgot about their only child in their fight and left her to the tides
until her father came for her in the middle of the night; the loneliness still resides

The sound of the desire is the sound of a piano
her music teacher had brushed his palm on her bosom while playing ballerina
That was the first time she had turned from a girl to a woman
whenever desire swells the keys of a piano play like an omen

Love makes a tingling sound forks and knives in the air
and then they drop to the floor he says thanks God you are well and fair
That was how she met him dashing against him in a gathering
knocking over a few cutlery items and his heart while she kept rambling

Lost was the sound of the train on the way to its destination
that was when her father died a train had passed by in the neighboring station
Love pain loss desire all feelings sound very different
and that is how she makes her colorless world more coherent

A thought walks past me
a light brush
just a touch and leave
rippling the ocean;
At first I dabble
then I swim
then drown
and float
Finally a poem takes birth
through silent touches
 
Old flames in new bottles
Old faces in new mirrors
Old hidden letters
Surface in a new library
Rippling the waters of
The existing relationship
Built on half-baked bricks
That collapse at the
Slightest breeze
 
This mind
a maze
of encircled
thoughts 
in circles
and loops
Not only 
people
I too
get lost
in its
intricacies
 
A poem sprouts and bursts
written and erased multiple times
Incomplete thoughts discarded feelings
I shut myself from the world
Shackle my mind to solitude
I can't let the poem vanish
I try to talk to it
 
but it does not speak back to me
I take a walk with my poem
Rest a while under the tree
The birds nestled on one of its branches
Chirp and sing a song of joy
The poem whispered itself
in the birds ears
I hear only the sound of the bird song
 
deaf to its words
I grab the tune and walk out with my poem
angry on the birds for stealing my lyrics
I walk to the beach the vastness of the sea inspiring
As the water cuddle my feet
 
froth bubbles spurt out in mild murmurs
I retrieve my lost poem
 
the sand tickling my feet with fresh words
The poem finally speaks to me
and happily I recite to my first audience the sea
After I finish my last word the sea explodes
and I stand exasperated in midst of the waves

Today I lost my poem to the sea its waves engulfed my words

We are two kites
entangled
in our strings
Either we soar high
or go down together
 
Here comes the November man
Who needed help to knead
the dough of life
He was busy making bread
But had lost the art of it
He forgot all the music
His songs disappeared in the corporate wind
 
She was the wildflower
of the first dawn
She offered him the rains of May
Alongside hopped a rainbow
Like a rabbit out of its furrow
Ready to plunge into the warm sunshine
 
He drank from the petals of her rain
A medicine healing him
From his monotonous business routines
Drenching him in joy and love
He found his love song
That he had tucked under his pillow
 
All the time it was there
In front of his eyes
But he had to find her
To find his music back
And the lost art of creating bread
  
But time ended for her
While it kept ticking for him
A few last grains of sand left
So he got her 12 beautiful gifts
One for every month
Celebrating the life she lived
And the precious love they had
They kissed one last time
In the golden autumn sun
In the middle of a road
Both went different ways
To him she was always a face and body
Who taught him love and life
She lived the last moments singing
Their love song
Then she became sweet November
Never ending eternal
 
We grew up playing rock-paper-scissors
He grew into a rock I became the paper
 
A frozen lake 
I have become
after you left
nothing survives
up here
the sun never rises
winters never set
Occasionally
underneath the layers
a carcass of 
thoughts float
that reminds of you
A fresh lake full of life
Now a dead zone
 
Take me to a place
where the horizon bends
where there are silvery clouds
and golden dew drops
where there are no borders and no LOC
where there is only you and me
I am not called a Christian
and you are not called a Hindu
 
Take me to a place
high on the hill
flooded with trees and flowers
butterfly and caterpillars dance
on top of the hill
is a lonely shiuli tree
let us lay in the shade of it
the shiuli flowers dropping
on our face lips and bodies
the fingers of a
Parsi and a Muslim entwined
 
Take me to a place
where all the rivers meet
and flow in one rhythm
a cadence transformed
into waterfalls
flowing on the rocks below
the rocks carved into
Vishnu Jesus Allah
All Gods at one place
FLEETING
 
I exist like the fleeting cloud
And the passing wind
 
I was never meant to stay
 
Rescue me from the depths of my thoughts
a dark tide a scarlet fold of delusional whispers
a constant incise of pine needles I see things
dreams that feel real hallucinations that are holistic
ah this vastness of the thoughts split in different zones
one part is day and one part is night
and several other parts shaded lingering between
light and darkness wrong and right real and fiction
an eternal hanging in this imperfect
perfect chaos of impressions
 
I dream of
corns and acorns
a squirrel running
a rabbit peeping
from its burrow
and a trail of ants
Everything happening
at the same time;
I am the 
corn and the acorn
squirrel and rabbit
An ant number 459
in the line
thinking that whether
any of the sugar cube
will be left after 458
ants have laid 
their hands on it
Even in my dream
my consciousness does
not leave me
I feel everything
and nothing
at the same time
 
Fractal seas
Locked in a pyramid
Thirsty for a sip
From the pool of your time
 
This perilous wait
Kills me softly
Every day the calendar
Turns a new page
 
My days and months
Frozen in the hourglass
On hold locked
Until you arrive

Rain mocks us the distance between us
Reminds me of the things we have done
In this room on wet nights like this insane
 
The taste of your kiss lingers on my wet lips
The aroma of your cologne fresh in this moistness;
Memories of your touch makes me wet once again
 
But you are like that cloud; about to rain
Yet pushed away by the sun once again…
 
Nude thoughts
Raindrops settling
On the leaves
 
Icicles on a rooftop
Melting dripping at the tips;
 
Drops of sweat falling
On my naked breasts –
This night a memory
In golden dust
Sprinkled over cold fire
 
Imprints of coral lips on a paper cup
A diamond ring abandoned by its owner
A forgotten silk scarf from the previous evening
A goodbye kiss etched on my cheek
A cold hug and the fading of her wild lily perfume
A voice that will only play in dreams henceforth…
 
This room now brims with sadness
of broken twigs from a dead relationship
too fresh and moist to kindle a fire
but waits for the twigs to dry out
and in its fire a new flame will rise
 
immersed in the rites
of a funeral of love
 
We are beads of the same string
But purposely I unknot
The other end and let you fall
 
Because you were
Not only weighing me down
But jeopardizing
The whole necklace

A scream originates from the forbidden
closets of my soul
but muffled up in my brain before
it reaches my lips
Finally what comes out is a gush of air
 
The scream reverberates in my head all day
I take dips in the river of screams
causing ripples that only my ears hear
Every ripple tosses me further into an ocean of
eternal loneliness
 
I have become deaf to the sounds of the world
What exists is an illusion where
I scream and listen
I sob and laugh
If you want me to hear you
you will have to enter my world
 
This too I am talking to myself in my head
and if you are listening to this
then you too are insane in the mad world
where I belong
 
Empty trains and stations
Deserted cities and towns
Abandoned streets and roads
Evacuated hospitals and dispensaries
Uninhabited shores and docks
Decamped forests and woods
Departed souls and spirits
Everything looks alike
And alike things look empty
 
My life is not an epitaph
But a novel with my autograph
You will have to immerse yourself
In different shades and hues
To understand my unique photograph
And then you will pierce the veil
Which has been stitched to my face
Beneath which lies my real self
To lose yourself in a brilliant poetry graph
 
Seasons came and went
They never affected her
She wore them in all shades
She was their muse
 
She hangs on to SPRING
so tightly in her fists
that it never escaped
the tips of her fingers
 
SUMMER was her hair clip
Her black traces tied together
Letting them loose
Would have clouded the sun
 
She spread love
Wherever she went
Even when it was not MONSOON
people experienced rains of her love
 
AUTUMN was her best buddy
Tucked warmly in her smile
An eternal celebration
Pouring life into dead souls
 
FALL was her fashion brigade
she could turn anything broken
Any anyone fallen
Into beautiful art
 
WINTER could never travel
higher than her cracked heels
Her lips were never chapped
Moisturized by her inner fire
 
My love was naked
you clothed it with lust
 
His memories played
a melancholic tune in allargando
The heart swelled
and emotions oozed out in tears
A dream in a dream he was
lost to the shadows of time
A fleeting cloud
Never mine an allargando rain

This Valentine
be my last kiss
the kiss of death
melt in my mouth
 
Let my tongue which
stinks of all sort of medicines
taste the mix of you and mint
coupled with cigarette ash
 
Cancer is killing me
but your love will
make me immortal
 
As I slip into darkness
the last thing that I
Want to linger on my soul
is YOU

One fine day I found an egg
Abandoned
subject to human stomping
My soft hands picked it up
and brought it home
I placed it in a warm place
Safe from the world
And daily I waited for the
little one to come out
Must be a birdie I thought
Another fine day the egg broke
and the little creature was gone
Must be a birdie I thought
I was sad that it flew away
I did not have a chance to know
how it looked and what it was
I placed the broken shells
in my glass cupboard
as a token in its memory
 
Days passed by and I kept
myself busy in the garden
until one night when I was
sound asleep
I heard a hiss
something moved slowly
and crawled on my bed
My brother who had heard the hiss
caught it and threw it away
The snake ran away and I jumped
out of the bed cowering with fear
 
An egg that I bought home
grew into a full size snake
only to attack its savior
after it had killed several small
pets in the garden
The broken shells continue
to adore the showcase
as a symbol for the lesson learnt
DO NOT TRUST SOMEONE
just because they are weak
It is possible that they can
act weak or innocent to gain
your trust and sympathy
 
There is a certain harmony 
when we kiss
I don't feel my heart
beating loud
or butterflies in my stomach
Or a passionate tingling 
Running through my body
Like a wave of electric current 
It feels that our bodies
Perfectly blend into each other
Like a jigsaw puzzle
That requires the last piece
to complete itself
‎Look at us love we 
‎form a beautiful picture
‎perfect for the frame of life

I lost the E
in giraffe
as a kid 
playing with the toys
 
I lost the O
in purpose
as a teenager
wading my life through
 
I lost the I
in I
as an adolescent
trying to redeem me
 
I lost the U
in struggle
as an old man
abandoned by his family
 
I lost the A
in ashes
as a dead body
burning on the pyre
 
I dream of golden sunshine
And dusky bards
A harp playing nearby
And butterflies fluttering
 
I dream of fireflies
And calves laughing
A lone grasshopper
Lost in the bamboo woods
 
I dream of ceremonies
And people clad in white
A guitar playing jubilant tunes
People dancing and foot tapping
 
I dream of Arabian nights
And wind storms
Mirages on sand dunes
Bedouin wings
Lost in the desert
Never to be found
 
The red rose in the vase bleeds alongside her
Like her it too was smelled and thrown away
 
I have gulped it all
without leaving a trace
But the remains
refuse to disappear
They loom over me
on lonely nights
making me breathless
I try to heave myself out
of the painful memories
Instead I end up puking all that
I have gulped
My bedroom floor turns
into a kaleidoscope of
your memories
I drown in my own tears
with the night sinking into me
This pain this suffering you don’t see
you lie in another woman’s coos
your lips singing her beauty
and I lie here entangled
in a web of lies and distrust
questioning my existence
and realization dawning
that I could never forget you
and on the other hand
it is you who gulped it all
without leaving a trace
of me in your life
I keep searching for your traces
in moments of everyday life
 
A night full of stars yet there isn't enough radiance
A party of friends on a rooftop yet there isn't love
A band of musicians playing yet there isn't melody
A galore of art and craft yet nothing touches the heart
 
So I walked out to the rainy night
hoping I will be missed
and as the cars crossed by
I wondered will I be missed if
one of these cars knocked me over
 
There will be condolences and
people will say few good things about me
for a day or two
 
I would miss myself
this pain of not being missed
not able to hear my heels on the road
not able to feel the rain on my face
not able to smell the aroma of the fresh coffee
and not able to wake up to the day
 
So I spun danced and sang as I walked
without a care in the world
enjoying the feeling of how badly I missed myself
I came home and crashed on my bed
feeling blessed that I would wake up to the light of the day
 
Fire smoke ash;
Desire still creeps in
With dust on bones
 
Rain walks silently
You tiptoe wet feet wet mind
Imprinted condemned

Hope a butterfly
Its wings torn but feels it has
Chance against the wind
 
Desire a centipede
Legs crawl in hidden places
Forbidden thoughts bloom
 
Hammocks in summer
Kisses linger on wet lips
Thoughts run wild with wind
I have burnt my bridges
I changed homes
I have walked on alien shores
and sang cheap ditties
written by others
 
I have cursed libraries
and stomped on golden verses
And when nothing offered me relief
I raised a knife to
plunge it deep inside my heart
then and there a dark
poem was passing by
it paused and sat near me
offering me refuge in its darkness

The knife carved us
beautifully into one 
I became the poem
the poem became me
 
In my refrigerator
you will find
sour curd
spoilt milk
rotting piece of meat
withered flowers
and my black heart
 
I hide my soul
in a pair of socks
and occasionally wear them
for a walk to know
how it feels to crush my soul
under my legs
 
It is funny
where my gut sits in my home
wrapped around the clock
on my bedside table
the alarm button of which
is on a snooze forever
 
The mind is
never at home
it floats on a lake
near my house;
it always gets to me
before I get to it
 
The brain is a library
each memory a book
but I do not know
which book is
stored on which shelf
and which page
belongs to which book
 
All my life 
I wore an invisible placard
screaming loud enough
for takers of love
I kept singing that
my love is for sale
and that it is free 
In the beginning
there was a big line
everyone posing 
as the perfect suitor
masking their true intentions
Body is what they sought
and heart is what they shattered
The placard is still there
and it reads  love for sale
And everyone reads it as
lust for sale
There are men who are ready
to buy skin and flesh
at any cost
But there aren't any to 
buy love free of cost
The placard is still there
waiting for a sale

Where the sparrows disappear
where the crows vanish
there is a place
where these birds
fall from the sky;
pigeons magpies
can no longer fly
they fall on the ground
and die as soon as
they dash against
the perimeter of that place
That place is your heart
Those birds are
my unrequited feelings
and I am the one fallen
doomed in love
 
I can swallow the entire sky
still stay hungry
I can drink an entire ocean
still stay thirsty
I can empty pitchers of perfumes
yet reek of deprivation

Amidst the silences of insanity
tiny fires dance on the tip of my fingers
feeding crumbs to the hungry dragon
hidden beneath this 55 and 70 kg flesh

This graveyard with a thousand and one
tombs of dead desires and feelings
the cold fire of poetry wakes up the
sleeping devil life begins again

When I kissed your lips
I gave a small part of mine
When I let myself to be
imprisoned in your arms
I gave a bit more of me to you
When I allowed you inside me
I not only gave my heart
but also my soul to you

And when you did not 
answer my call the next day
and blocked me everywhere
I knew then what I lost
My ability to TRUST

All that I could 
salvage of us
is a memory

Sometimes
it trickles 
as a tear

And sometimes
it is the blanket
on a cold night

But mostly it is
an old pair of jeans that 
does not fit anymore

Somedays I am Kafka's knife
cutting the melancholy of the empty night
a poem that has turned inside out
a warsong that has long been forgotten
an inferno of fire rain
mixed with stardust and tears of the sun
 
Somedays I am grains of dust
settling on the yellow pages
of an unopened book
of Sylvia Plath's suicidal notes
or mediating on the unibrow of Frida Kahlo's 
self portrait plastered on my bedroom wall
 
Somedays I am sheer ecstasy
sputtering in sparks
a colour bomb exploding in variant hues
Shakespeare's love poem 
a Juliet who completes herself
without a Romeo
 
Somedays I am a lost language
talking in arrays and metaphors
hiding my agony in verses
a sheath trying to find its sword
a name  Kamla Surayya or Madhavi
in quest of her identity

Like an onion
I sit on a tray
and watch this world
and its suffering
weeping silently
my tears frozen
in the layers of
my skin
When you cut
me open
my tears
flow through
your eyes

My body reminds me
that your mouth
was here
and here
and here too
and how you had
said with so much
love in your eyes
that it was
your home
your haven;
but all the while
you were
treating it as a
luxury hotel

I write to myself an unposted letter
of how I grew up wanting to become better
of how my emotions once soft and tender
have now been reduced to a dump of  litter 
 
My body grew beautiful and seductive
my soul grew dark and destructive
I ask myself if there is any pinch of innocence left
experience had worked its way neat and deft 
 
I concoct stories to tell my aged self
though I have been stacking ideas on a shelf
thoughts that were larger than my tiny self
a deviation of the said path by my tainted self 
 
The pen writes in rivulets of ink
the words of a guilty conscience sink
in the stream of blood the soul shrinks
in remorse a thumb tack constantly pricks 
 
I wish I could wear my skin 
inside out
and let it scream at your
white face
that anatomically 
you and me
look the same

Our hearts pump the blood
and our lungs breathe the air
Just because of Melanin
why am I bullied by the
gang of pretty white girls

I do bleed like you once in a month
I do have the same sex organs
Then why am I mocked at my skin colour
The rainbow is beautiful 
because of all of its seven colours
every colour has its own beauty and place
otherwise everything and all the things
on this earth would be simply white

And how plants and seas would look
so pale if they weren't green and blue
I take pride in being brown the colour of earth
and if you feel you are supreme because of white skin 
then Toilet paper too is white

You a tinge of mahogany
Me the brown dust of earth

How I want to melt in your skin
turning a shade darker
wrapped into your body
like a wound spring of the clock
ticking in your breaths
and unwinding to the
rhythm of your heart beat

When people would ask 
where is the brown girl
I would say:
I am Mahogany now
I am him

The mirror shows my true face
no matter how hard I try to hide
beneath tons of makeup 
and a magnificent smile
The void in my eyes
the trembling lips that taste
the salt from my invisible tears
my sorrows looking over me
like a dark cloud on a bright day;
all of these I hide cleverly
putting my best smile
and it is a relief that
corneas are not mirrors
and people can never see
the tears underneath my lovely smile
So I blend along with the crowd
and once in a while
peer into the mirror to 
acquaint with my true self

I am a fallen cloud
Abandoned by Mother Sky
Exiled with the word taboo
etched on my skin
one that reeks of rebellion
skin that will moult 
a few moons from now
like fresh green leaves
of the spring with
increased fervour
set to conquer the world
The Gods say I am a misfit
men say I should be raped
to be taught to behave
Women say I am impure
I bleed very often
some days biologically
And most days by mouth
So words have power but 
when the world is a fool's paradise
words are a miss
the mouth bleeds
and the heart rains
distorted verses
a black poem undeciphered
like Lilith cast away
in rebuke for voicing
equality for women
for wearing her desires on her skin
for refusing to surrender
like Durga worshipped in temples
but crumpled under the male feet on the streets while women watch helplessly
whose souls are devoured by PATRIARCHY
and men continue to offer prayers 
to the Goddess in the temple while the Goddess at home weeps in silence
Here too I was an out cast my wings burnt my newly moulted skin again 
condemned
They put me on a pyre 
but the fire refused to burn me 
for I was pure forged from 
the very fire of life
The sky then opened its arms 
to claim her daughter back 
a fallen cloud I was pure 
certified by the fire God
I was now goddess 
without a throne 
and a crown made of thorns
who bleeds daily
A temple built and locked 
with darshan in sacred hours
a basalt showering boons 
and drinking milk sometimes
Nevertheless a goddess just 
for the sake of goddess
And all the while 
my daughters are suffering

Such is the story of
a woman a fallen cloud a fallen womb

Your kisses are lies
reeking of  her
Each time I kiss you
I taste a deception
Your tongue
gives me blisters
from all those women
in whose mouth
you have stuck it;
I have borne it all
granting you many chances
but no more
 
I refuse to be one of your
mouth freshners
I would rather be a lip balm
and spread on chapped
but honest lips 

Your words are
rose petals dunked in sugar syrup
but they taste acid on my tongue
burning my mouth
So I set fire to your words
and watch them burn
the ash scattering in the wind
lies in a pile of lies
 
Once you have
felt my skin
tasted my lips
got entangled in my hair knots
rested your head between my thighs
tapped your fingers like playing a piano on my belly
  
Would you
search for me in every other woman you would sleep with
feel me in the skin of the woman you might fall in love with
want me to be the wife you would choose later in life?
 
Would you
allow my memory to fade with time
or let it seep in through your life ultimately cracking it
lock my touch my taste my smell in the deepest crevice of your heart?
 
Would you ever forget me once you made love to me?
 
Would you ever make love to another woman the way you made to me?
And would you ever kiss another woman as if you were kissing her for the last time in your life?
 
Forlorn winds take me to yesteryears
on a derelict bridge over a dried river
I meet familiar worn out faces in shiver
 
The face of love and the face of hate
pain and happiness peace and chaos
regrets and desires many more covered in moss
 
There is a face distant and undecipherable
perhaps the face of death it is not time yet
and yet a storm comes down like a crashing jet
 
I ponder what actions invited the grim reaper
all the faces swirl around the one in distance
death is nearing for I lost the important face
 
I search through the gales and the seas
above the skies and under the earth
I had set it on fire tossing it into a hearth
 
The bridge falls down into the ravine
along with it all the faces jump in terror
death latches over my new face of despair

Tender saplings
we are
two earthlings
one core
he a wild hunter
me a mild doe
blindly in love
with my savior

But very soon
the day came
of my doom
Nothing was the same
the dance of the fires
from the hunter’s arrows
burnt me into ashes
strewn across the skies

A story written in gold
of a sapling wasted in love

You read me like a novel
every page interesting and gripping
there were pages of pain and grieving
and then there were pages of healing
of romance rage and silliness
of courage resilience and foolishness
The more you read me 
a little bit more you loved me
and a little bit more you hated me
But I had laid it all in front of you
the naked me my core my depth
The last page of my novel was blank
waiting to be written reserved for you
Instead you tore it and whispered in my ears
Happy endings aren't for bad girls like you
And I screamed at your face
exquisite poetry isn't for cheap boys like you
 
I drew a dream in my head
and painted it with words
I planned to share with you
this dream of me and you
and a life together
 
At your door she greeted me;
her only robe a blue shirt 
a birthday gift to you from me

She called out your name 
half naked and a stunned look
matched my shock

She drew your arms
around her waist
and pierced my dreams
vaporizing them in evanescence

This dream now folds itself
a whirlpool of painted words
distorted scattered

A rain of ash on my face;
a black rivulet on my cheeks
crystallized into moles
a visible pair of scars

A dream lived
by someone else
A shirt that adorned 
a lover a husband
to someone else

Hence

I drank the seas
the ships 
the beacons
and the light towers
 
For you shall have
neither my love
nor anyone's

I renounced my love for you at your door
tell your new lover that it is my gift for her
tell her to knot my gift in the edge of her favourite saree
and store it in her attic
The day when you leave her
let her unknot my gift
I will be waiting outside
to receive her
I will whisper into her ears
being dumped is not that bad
when you have someone to 
share the mutual feelings
 
I paint my desires on a wall
made of glass ash and stardust
an origami of sunflowers
in lilac and pastel shades
forged with unfulfilled stories
of my predecessors
and of trapped dreams
in ivory boxes
bordered with blood
while naked bodies stare at me
from the other side of the wall
with stardust smeared
on their bodies
and ash smudged around
their eyes
fallen angels
condemned for painting
their desires on walls once
Glasses shatter desires burn
and one day with them
misogyny will burn too

With desires on show on my skin
Gooseflesh tattooed in ink 
Spoken words cling to me
Ingrained in images
They read the open book
Of thoughts loud enough for you to hear
The voices
On my serrated flesh

A black dove perches
Wings spread out on my shoulder
A bleeding rose on my right butt 
Its thorns on my left
Fire on my left breast 
Waterfall on my right

A flute on my belly button
Small icons screaming loud 
The word 'BOLD' etched just beneath

An invisible label stamped on my forehead
Reads 'RUINED' in smudged black print
A reward for wearing my thoughts of sin

So I went and got it etched on my arm
a mirror image of the letters
the truth of their own lives…

Ivory ink
spills on
letters of pink
a history foretold
woman you 
shall be sold;
not in bazaars
not at brothels
a two-edged scissors
at home as easy as
an egg and a sausage
a very legal term
called 'marriage'
 
You and me
two autumn leaves
fallen and swept
in opposite directions
by the winds of fate 
 
Know this one you
Knock the door of my heart
Rub off your past on the door mat
And leave the baggage outside
 
Remember this I am not a
Medium for your release
Neither you are a project to me
Nor have I taken the 
Responsibility to shape you
 
Before you even ring the doorbell
Read the sign written in bold letters
Which reads:
GUESTS ARE NOT WELCOME

Paper moons crystal words
a song written in dew;
An easel of raw desires
the paint my soul

Lover come over
An unfinished bottle of whiskey
waits for the touch of your lips

Parijata's scent fuzzy memories
a mild brag of the rain;
The lone guava tree
its branches drooping

Lover come over
Let's unfold a poem 
in the cracks of the night

Fire's crackle my heart's roar
a sea stuck at my throat
The low hum of 
a wingedwish

Lover come over
I held death in my fists far too long
the fingers may crack open

Last night
the moon shrunk
A lone thorn bird
sang it's last song
Life that was once
jaggery and flowing honey
pickled sauce and a salted curry
bitter evenings and sour mornings
became one long artery of nostalgia
This morning
the sun ate herself

Love is both
fire and rain
It sets you on fire
and then douses you
with rain
leaving you
half burnt
half quenched
And so you will
always remain 
HALF
to be full
Only when joined
with your other half
